    The
    <!--(/sc)-->
    summits of the loftiest mountains were already illumined by
 the rays of the rising sun, the shades of night were fled, and all things
 plainly visible, when the queen and her company arose, and hied
 them first to the dewy mead, where for a while they walked: then,
 about half tierce, they wended their way to a little church that
 was hard by, where they heard Divine service; after which, they
 returned to the palace, and having breakfasted with gay and gladsome
 cheer, and sung and danced a while, were dismissed by the
	queen, to rest them as to each might seem good.

    But when the sun
 was past the meridian, the queen mustered them again for their
 wonted pastime; and, all being seated by the fair fountain, thus, at
 her command, Neifile began.
