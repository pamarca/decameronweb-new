which we call Lucifer, which still glowed in the whitening dawn, when uprose the
seneschal, and with a goodly baggage-train hied him to the Ladies' Vale, there to make all
things ready according to the ordinance and commandment of the king. <milestone id="p07980003" />Nor was it
long after his departure that the king rose, being awaked by the stir and bustle that the
servants made in lading the horses, and being risen he likewise roused all the ladies and
the other gallants; <milestone id="p07980004" />and so, when as yet 'twas scarce clear daybreak, they all
took the road; nor seemed it to them that the nightingales and the other birds had ever
chanted so blithely as that morning. By which choir they were attended to the Ladies'
Vale, where they were greeted by other warblers not a few, that seemed rejoiced at their
arrival. <milestone id="p07980005" />Roving about the vale, and surveying its beauties afresh, they rated
them higher than on the previous day, as indeed the hour was more apt to shew them
forth. <milestone id="p07980006" />Then with good wine and comfits they broke their fast, and, that they
might not lag behind the songsters, they fell a singing, whereto the vale responded, ever
echoing their strains; nor did the birds, as minded not to be beaten, fail to swell the
chorus with notes of unwonted sweetness. <milestone id="p07980007" />However, breakfast-time came, and
then, the tables being laid under a living canopy of trees, and beside other goodly trees
that fringed the little lake, they sat them down in order as to the king seemed meet. So
they took their meal, <pb n="113" />glancing from time to time at the lake, where the fish
darted to and fro in multitudinous shoals, which afforded not only delight to their eyes
but matter for converse. <milestone id="p07980008" />Breakfast ended, and the tables
removed, they fell a singing again more blithely than before. <milestone id="p07980009" />After which,

that cared not to sleep might betake them, as each might choose, to any of their wonted

the place where they had breakfasted; and, all having sat them down beside the lake, he
bade Emilia begin; which, blithe and smiling, Emilia did on this wise.</p></div2><pb n="114" /><div2 type="novella" who="emilia" id="nov0701"><head>Novel I</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07010001" />Gianni Lotteringhi hears a knocking at his door at night: he

afraid of it, you may learn from this my story how to put it to flight, should it intrude
upon you, with a holy, salutary and most efficacious orison.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p07010004" />There dwelt of yore at
Florence, in the quarter of San Pancrazio, a master-spinner, Gianni Lotteringhi by name,
one that had prospered in his business, but had little understanding of aught else;
insomuch that being somewhat of a simpleton, he had many a time been chosen leader of the
band of laud-singers of Santa Maria Novella, and had charge of their school; and not a few
like offices had he often served, upon which he greatly plumed himself. Howbeit, 'twas all
for no other reason than that, being a man of substance, he gave liberal doles to the
friars; <milestone id="p07010005" />who, for that they got thereof, this one hose, another a cloak, and a
third a hood, would teach him good orisons, or give him the paternoster in the vernacular,
or the chant of St. Alexis, or the lament of St. Bernard, or the laud of Lady
<pb n="115" />Matilda, or the like sorry stuff, which he greatly prized, and guarded with
jealous care, deeming them all most conducive to the salvation of his soul.</p><p><milestone id="p07010006" />Now our
simple master-spinner had a most beautiful wife, and amorous withal, her name Monna
Tessa. Daughter she was of Mannuccio dalla Cuculla, and not a little knowing and
keen-witted; and being enamoured of Federigo di Neri Pegolotti, a handsome and lusty
gallant, as he also of her, she, knowing her husband's simplicity, took counsel with her
maid, and arranged that Federigo should come to chat with her at a right goodly
pleasure-house that the said Gianni had at Camerata, where she was wont to pass the
summer, <milestone id="p07010007" />Gianni coming now and again to sup and sleep, and going back in the
morning to his shop, or, maybe, to his laud-singers. <milestone id="p07010008" />Federigo, who desired
nothing better, went up there punctually on the appointed day about vespers, and as the
evening passed without Gianni making his appearance, did most comfortably, and to his no
small satisfaction, sup and sleep with the lady, who lying in his arms taught him that
night some six of her husband's lauds. <milestone id="p07010009" />But, as neither she nor Federigo was
minded that this beginning should also be the end of
their intercourse, and that it might not be needful for the maid to go each time to make
the assignation with him, they came to the following understanding; <milestone id="p07010010" />to wit,
that as often as he came and went between the house and an estate that he had a little
higher up, he should keep an eye on a vineyard that was beside the house, where he would
see an ass's head stuck on one of the poles of the vineyard, and as often as he observed
the muzzle turned towards Florence, he might visit her without any sort of misgiving; and
if he found not the door open, he was to tap it thrice, and she would open it; and when he
saw the muzzle of the ass's head turned towards Fiesole, he was to keep away, for then
Gianni would be there.
<milestone id="p07010011" />Following which plan, they forgathered not seldom: 
<milestone id="p07010012" />but on one of
these evenings, when Federigo was to sup with Monna Tessa on two fat capons that she had
boiled, it so chanced that Gianni arrived there unexpectedly and very late, much to the
lady's chagrin: so she had a little salt meat boiled apart, on which she supped with her
husband; <milestone id="p07010013" />and the maid by her orders carried the two boiled capons laid in a
spotless napkin with plenty of fresh eggs and a bottle of good wine into the garden, to
which there was access <pb n="116" />otherwise than from the house, and where she was wont
at times to sup with Federigo; and there the maid set them down at the foot of a
peach-tree, that grew beside a lawn. <milestone id="p07010014" />But in her vexation she forgot to tell the
maid to wait till Federigo should come, and let him know that Gianni was there, and he
must take his supper in the
garden: <milestone id="p07010015" />and she and Gianni and the maid were scarce gone to bed, when Federigo
came and tapped once at the door, which being hard by the bedroom, Gianni heard the tap,
as did also the lady, albeit, that Gianni might have no reason to suspect her, she feigned
to be asleep. <milestone id="p07010016" />Federigo waited a little, and then gave a second tap; whereupon,
wondering what it might mean, Gianni nudged his wife, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Tessa, dost hear what I
hear? Methinks some one has tapped at our door.</q> <milestone id="p07010017" />The lady, who had heard the
noise much better than he, feigned to wake up, and: <q direct="unspecified">How? what sayst thou?</q> quoth
she. <milestone id="p07010018" /><q direct="unspecified">I say,</q> replied Gianni, <q direct="unspecified">that, meseems, some one has tapped at our
door.</q> <milestone id="p07010019" /><q direct="unspecified">Tapped at it?</q> quoth the lady. <q direct="unspecified">Alas, my Gianni, wottest thou
not what that is? 'Tis the
bogey, which for some nights past has so terrified me as never was,
insomuch that I never hear it but I pop my head under the clothes and venture not to put
it out again until 'tis broad day.</q> <milestone id="p07010020" /><q direct="unspecified">Come, come, wife,</q> quoth Gianni,
<q direct="unspecified">if such it is, be not alarmed; for before we got into bed I repeated the Te
lucis, the
Intemerata, and divers other good orisons, besides which I made the
sign of the cross in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit at each corner of the
bed; wherefore we need have no fear that it may avail to hurt us, whatever be its
power.</q> <milestone id="p07010021" />The lady, lest Federigo, perchance suspecting a rival, should take
offence, resolved to get up, and let him understand that Gianni was there: so she said to
her husband: <q direct="unspecified">Well, well; so sayst thou; but I for my part shall never deem myself safe
and secure, unless we exorcise it, seeing that thou art here.</q> <milestone id="p07010022" /><q direct="unspecified">Oh!</q>
said Gianni, <q direct="unspecified">and how does one exorcise it?</q> <milestone id="p07010023" /><q direct="unspecified">That,</q> quoth the lady,
<q direct="unspecified">I know right well; for t'other day, when I went to Fiesole for the pardoning, one of
those anchoresses, the saintliest creature, my Gianni, God be my witness, knowing how much
afraid I am of the bogey, taught me a holy and salutary orison, which she said she had
tried many a time before she was turned anchoress, and always with success. <milestone id="p07010024" />God
wot, I should never have had courage to try it alone; but as thou art here, I propose that
<pb n="117" />we go exorcise it together.</q> <milestone id="p07010025" />Gianni made answer that he was
quite of the same mind; so up they got, and stole to the door, on the outside of which
Federigo, now suspicious, was still waiting. And as soon as they were there: <q direct="unspecified">Now,</q>
quoth the lady to Gianni, <q direct="unspecified">thou wilt spit, when I tell thee.</q> <milestone id="p07010026" /><q direct="unspecified">Good,</q>
said Gianni. <milestone id="p07010027" />Whereupon the lady began her orison, saying:</p><p>      <q type="prayer" direct="unspecified" who="monnatessa">	 Bogey,
	bogey that goest by night, Tail erect, thou cam'st, tail erect, take thy flight:
	Hie thee to the garden, and the great peach before, Grease upon grease, and
	droppings five score Of my hen shalt thou find: Set the flask thy lips to,
	Then away like the wind, And no scathe unto me or my Gianni do.</q> And when she
	had done: <q direct="unspecified">Now, Gianni,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">spit</q>: and Gianni spat.</p><p><milestone id="p07010028" />There was no more room for jealousy in Federigo's mind as he heard all this
	from without; nay, for all his disappointment, he was like to burst with
	suppressed laughter, and when Gianni spat, he muttered under his breath: <q direct="unspecified">Now
	out with thy teeth.</q> <milestone id="p07010029" />The lady, having after this fashion thrice
	exorcised the bogey, went back to bed with her husband. <milestone id="p07010030" />Federigo,
	disappointed of the supper that he was to have had with her, and apprehending the
	words of the orison aright, hied him to the garden, and having found the two
	capons and the wine and the eggs at the foot of the peach-tree, took them home
	with him, and supped very comfortably. And many a hearty laugh had he and the lady
	over the exorcism during their subsequent intercourse.</p><p><milestone id="p07010031" />Now, true it is that
	some say that the lady had in fact turned the ass's head towards Fiesole, but that
	a husbandman, passing through the vineyard, had given it a blow with his stick,
	whereby it had swung round, and remained fronting Florence, and so it was that
	Federigo thought that he was invited, and came to the house, <milestone id="p07010032" />and that
	the lady's orison was on this wise:
	<q type="prayer" direct="unspecified" who="monnatessa">	  Bogey, a God's name, away thee hie, For whoe'er turned the ass's head, 'twas not I;
	  Another it was, foul fall his eyne; And here am I with Gianni mine.</q></p><pb n="118" /><p>Wherefore Federigo was fain to take himself off, having neither slept nor
supped.</p><p><milestone id="p07010033" />But a neighbour of mine, a lady well advanced in years, tells me that, by
what she heard when she was a girl, both stories are true; but that the latter concerned
not Gianni Lotteringhi but one Gianni di Nello, that lived at Porta San Piero, and was no
less a numskull than Gianni Lotteringhi. <milestone id="p07010034" />Wherefore, dear my ladies, you are at
liberty to choose which exorcism you prefer, or take both if you like.  They are both of
extraordinary and approved virtue in such cases, as you have heard: get them by heart,
therefore, and they may yet stand you in good stead.</p></div2><pb n="119" /><div2 type="novella" who="filostrato" id="nov0702"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07020001" />Her husband returning home, Peronella bestows her lover in a tun;

	so many are the tricks that men play you, and most of all your husbands, that, when from
	time to time it so befalls that some lady plays her husband a trick, the circumstance,
	whether it come within your own cognizance or be told you by another, should not only give

	<milestone id="p07020005" />Can we doubt, then, that, should but the converse that we shall hold
	to-day touching this matter come to be bruited among men, 'twould serve to put a most
	notable check upon the tricks they play you, by doing them to wit of the tricks, which
	you, in like manner, when you are so minded, may play them? <milestone id="p07020006" />Wherefore 'tis my
	intention to tell you in what manner a young girl, albeit she was but of low rank, did, on
	the spur of the moment, beguile her husband to her own deliverance.</p></div3><pb n="120" /><p><milestone id="p07020007" />'Tis no long time since at Naples a poor man, a mason by craft, took to wife a fair and
amorous maiden--Peronella was her name--who eked out by spinning what her husband made by
his craft; and so the pair managed as best they might on very slender
means. <milestone id="p07020008" />And as chance would have it, one of the gallants of the city, taking
note of this Peronella one day, and being mightily pleased with her, fell in love with
her, and by this means and that so prevailed that he won her to accord him her
intimacy. <milestone id="p07020009" />Their times of forgathering they concerted as follows: to wit, that,
her husband being wont to rise betimes of a morning to go to work or seek for work, the
gallant was to be where he might see him go forth, and, the street where she dwelt, which
is called Avorio, being scarce inhabited, was to come
into the house as soon as her husband was well out of it; and so times not a few they
did. <milestone id="p07020010" />But on one of these occasions it befell that, the good man being gone
forth, and Giannello Sirignario--such was the gallant's name--being come into the house,
and being with Peronella, after a while, back came the good man, though 'twas not his wont
to return until the day was done; and finding the door locked, he knocked, and after
knocking, he fell a saying to himself: <milestone id="p07020011" />O God, praised be Thy name forever; for
that, albeit Thou hast ordained that I be poor, at least Thou hast accorded me the
consolation of a good and honest girl for wife. Mark what haste she made to shut the door
when I was gone forth, that none else might enter to give her trouble.</p><p><milestone id="p07020012" />Now
Peronella knew by his knock that 'twas her husband; wherefore: <q direct="unspecified">Alas, Giannello
mine,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">I am a dead woman, for lo, here is my husband, foul fall him! come
back! What it may import, I know not, for he is never wont to come back at this hour;
perchance he caught sight of thee as thou camest in. <milestone id="p07020013" />However, for the love of
God, be it as it may, get thee into this tun that thou seest here, and I will go open to
him, and we shall see what is the occasion of this sudden return this morning.</q>
<milestone id="p07020014" />So Giannello forthwith got into the tun, and Peronella went to the door, and
let in her husband, and gave him black looks, saying: <q direct="unspecified">This is indeed a surprise that
thou art back so soon this morning! By what I see thou hast a mind to make this a holiday,
that thou returnest tools in hand; if so, what are we to live on? whence shall we get
bread to eat? Thinkest thou I will let thee pawn my gown and other bits <pb n="121" />of
clothes? Day and night I do nought else but spin, insomuch that the flesh is fallen away
from my nails, that at least I may have oil enough to keep our lamp
alight. <milestone id="p07020015" />Husband, husband, there is never a woman in the neighbourhood but
marvels and mocks at me, that I am at such labour and pains; and thou comest home to me
with thy hands hanging idle, when thou shouldst be at work.</q> <milestone id="p07020016" />Which said, she
fell a weeping and repeating: <q direct="unspecified">Alas, alas, woe's me, in what evil hour was I born? in
what luckless moment came I hither, I, that might have had so goodly a young man, and I
would not, to take up with one that bestows never a thought on her whom he has made his
wife? <milestone id="p07020017" />Other women have a good time with their lovers, and never a one have we
here but has two or three; they take their pleasure, and make their husbands believe that
the moon is the sun; and I, alas! for that I am an honest woman, and have no such casual
amours, I suffer, and am hard bested: I know not why I provide not myself with one of
these lovers, as others do. <milestone id="p07020018" />Give good heed, husband, to what I say: were I
disposed to dishonour thee, I were at no loss to find the man: for here are gallants
enough, that love me, and court me, and have sent me many an offer of money--no stint--or
dresses or jewels, should I prefer them; but my pride would never suffer it, because I was
not born of a woman of that sort: and now thou comest home to me when thou oughtest to be
at work.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07020019" />Whereto the husband: <q direct="unspecified">Wife, wife, for God's sake distress not
thyself: thou shouldst give me credit for knowing what manner of woman thou art, as indeed
I have partly seen this morning. True it is that I went out to work; but 'tis plain that
thou knowest not, as indeed I knew not, <milestone id="p07020020" />that to-day 'tis the feast of San
Galeone, and a holiday, and that is why I am come home at this hour; but nevertheless I
have found means to provide us with bread for more than a month; for I have sold to this
gentleman, whom thou seest with me, the tun, thou wottest of, seeing that it has
encumbered the house so long, and he will give me five gigliats for it.</q>
<milestone id="p07020021" />Quoth then Peronella: <q direct="unspecified">And all this but adds to my trouble: thou, that art a
man, and goest abroad, and shouldst know affairs, hast sold for five gigliats a tun, which
I, that am but a woman, and was scarce ever out of doors, have, for that it took up so
much room in the house, sold for seven gigliats to a good man, that but now, as thou
cam'st back, got therein, to see if 'twere sound.</q> <milestone id="p07020022" />So hearing, the husband
was over<pb n="122" />joyed, and said to the man that was come to take it away; <q direct="unspecified">Good man,
I wish thee Godspeed; for, as thou hearest, my wife has sold the tun for seven gigliats,
whereas thou gavest me only five.</q> <milestone id="p07020023" />Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">So be it,</q> said the good
man, and took himself off.  <milestone id="p07020024" />Then said Peronella to her husband: <q direct="unspecified">Now, as thou
art here, come
up, and arrange the matter with the good man.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07020025" />Now Giannello, who, meanwhile,
had been all on the alert to discover if there were aught he had to fear or be on his
guard against, no sooner heard Peronella's last words, than he sprang out of the tun, and
feigning to know nought of her husband's return, began thus: <q direct="unspecified">Where art thou, good
dame?</q> <milestone id="p07020026" />Whereto the husband, coming up, answered: <q direct="unspecified">Here am I: what wouldst
thou of me?</q> <milestone id="p07020027" />Quoth Giannello: <q direct="unspecified">And who art thou? I would speak with the
lady with whom I struck the bargain for this tun.</q> <milestone id="p07020028" />Then said the good
man: <q direct="unspecified">Have no fear, you can deal with me; for I am her husband.</q>
<milestone id="p07020029" />Quoth then Giannello: <q direct="unspecified">The tun seems to me sound enough; but I think you must
have let the lees remain in it; for 'tis all encrusted with I know not what that is so
dry, that I cannot raise it with the nail; wherefore I am not minded to take it unless I
first see it scoured.</q> <milestone id="p07020030" />Whereupon Peronella: <q direct="unspecified">To be sure: that shall not
hinder the bargain; my husband will scour it clean.</q> <milestone id="p07020031" />And: <q direct="unspecified">Well and
good,</q> said the husband.</p><p>So he laid down his tools, stripped himself to his
vest, sent for a light and a rasp, and was in the tun, and scraping away, in a trice.
<milestone id="p07020032" />Whereupon Peronella, as if she were curious to see what he did, thrust her head
into the vent of the tun, which was of no great size, and
therewithal one of her arms up to the shoulder, and fell a saying:
<q direct="unspecified">Scrape here, and here, and there too, and look, there is a bit left
here.</q> <milestone id="p07020033" />So, she being in this posture, directing and admonishing her
husband, Giannello, who had not, that morning, fully satisfied his desire, when the
husband arrived, now seeing that as he would, he might not, brought his mind to his
circumstances, and resolved to take his pleasure as he might: <milestone id="p07020034" />wherefore he made
up to the lady, who completely blocked the vent of the tun; and even on such wise as on
the open champaign the wild and lusty horses do amorously assail the mares of Parthia, he
sated his youthful appetite; and so it was that almost at the same moment that he did so,
and was off, the tun was scoured, the husband came forth of it, and <pb n="123" />Peronella
withdrew her head from the vent, <milestone id="p07020035" />and turning to
Giannello, said: <q direct="unspecified">Take this light, good man, and see if 'tis scoured to thy mind.</q>
<milestone id="p07020036" />Whereupon Giannello, looking into the tun, said that 'twas in good trim, and
that he was well content, and paid the husband the seven gigliats, and caused him carry
the tun to his house.</p></div2><pb n="124" /><div2 type="novella" who="elissa" id="nov0703"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07030001" />Fra Rinaldo lies with his gossip: her

that, if he could but find means to speak with her privately, he might have of her all

displeasing to the lady to hear, it availed him but little.</p><p><milestone id="p07030006" />Now not long afterwards
it so befell that, whatever may have been his reason, Rinaldo betook him to friarage; and
whether it <pb n="125" />was that he found good pasture therein, or what not, he persevered
in that way of life. <milestone id="p07030007" />And though for a while after he was turned friar, he laid
aside the love he bore his gossip, and certain other vanities, yet in course of time,
without putting off the habit, he resumed them, and began to take a pride in his
appearance, and to go dressed in fine clothes, and to be quite the trim gallant, and to
compose songs and sonnets and ballades, and to sing them, and to make a brave shew in all
else that pertained to his new character.  <milestone id="p07030008" />But why enlarge upon our Fra
Rinaldo, of whom we speak?  what friars are there that do not the like? Ah! opprobrium of
a corrupt
world! <milestone id="p07030009" />Sleek-faced and sanguine, daintily clad, dainty in all their
accessories, they ruffle it shamelessly before the eyes of all, shewing
not as doves but as insolent cocks with raised crest and swelling bosom, <milestone id="p07030010" />and,
what is worse (to say nought of the vases full of electuaries and unguents, the boxes
packed with divers comfits, the pitchers and phials of artificial waters, and oils, the
flagons brimming with Malmsey and Greek and other wines of finest quality, with which
their cells are so packed that they shew not as the cells of friars, but rather as
apothecaries' or perfumers' shops), they blush not to be known to be gouty, flattering
themselves that other folk wot not that long fasts and many of them, and coarse fare and
little of it, and sober living, make men lean and thin and for the most part healthy;
<milestone id="p07030011" />or if any malady come thereof, at any rate 'tis not the gout, the wonted remedy
for which is chastity and all beside that
belongs to the regimen of a humble friar. <milestone id="p07030012" />They flatter themselves, too, that
others wot not that over and above the meagre diet, long vigils and orisons and strict
discipline ought to mortify men and make them pale, and that neither St. Dominic nor
St. Francis went clad in stuff dyed in grain or any other goodly garb, but in coarse
woollen habits innocent of the dyer's art, made to keep out the cold, and not for shew. To
which matters 'twere well God had a care, no less than to the souls of the simple folk by
whom our friars are nourished.</p><p><milestone id="p07030013" />Fra Rinaldo, then, being come back to his first
affections, took to visiting his gossip very frequently; and gaining confidence, began
with more insistence than before to solicit her to that which he craved of
her. <milestone id="p07030014" />So, being much urged, the good lady, to whom Fra Rinaldo, perhaps, seemed
now more handsome than of yore, had
<pb n="126" />recourse one day, when she felt herself unusually hard pressed by him, to the
common expedient of all that would fain concede what is asked of them, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Oh!
but Fra Rinaldo, do friars then do this sort of thing?</q> <milestone id="p07030015" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q>
replied Fra Rinaldo, <q direct="unspecified">when I divest myself of this habit, which I shall do easily
enough, you will see that I am a man furnished as other men, and no friar.</q>
<milestone id="p07030016" />Whereto with a truly comical air the lady made answer: <q direct="unspecified">Alas! woe's me!  you
are my child's godfather: how might it be? nay, but 'twere a very great mischief; and many
a time I have heard that 'tis a most heinous sin; and without a doubt, were it not so, I
would do as you wish.</q> <milestone id="p07030017" /><q direct="unspecified">If,</q> said Fra Rinaldo, <q direct="unspecified">you forego it for
such a scruple as this, you are a fool for your pains. I say not that 'tis no sin; but
there is no sin so great but God pardons it, if one repent. Now tell me: whether is more
truly father to your son, I that held him at the font, or your husband that begot him?</q>
<milestone id="p07030018" /><q direct="unspecified">My husband,</q> replied the lady. 
<milestone id="p07030019" /><q direct="unspecified">Sooth say you,</q> returned
the friar, <q direct="unspecified">and does not your husband lie with you?</q> <milestone id="p07030020" /><q direct="unspecified">Why, yes,</q> said
the lady. <milestone id="p07030021" /><q direct="unspecified">Then,</q> rejoined the friar, <q direct="unspecified">I that am less truly your son's
father than your husband, ought also to lie with you, as does your husband.</q>
<milestone id="p07030022" />The lady was no logician, and needed little to sway her: she therefore believed
or feigned to believe that what the friar said was true. So: <q direct="unspecified">Who might avail to answer
your words of wisdom?</q> quoth she; and presently forgot the godfather in the lover, and
complied with
his desires. Nor had they begun their course to end it forthwith: but under cover of the
friar's sponsorship, which set them more at ease, as it rendered them less open to
suspicion, they forgathered again and again.</p><p><milestone id="p07030023" />But on one of these occasions it so
befell that Fra Rinaldo, being come to the lady's house, where he espied none else save a
very
pretty and dainty little maid that waited on the lady, sent his companion
away with her into the pigeon-house, there to teach her the paternoster, while he and the
lady, holding her little boy by the hand, went into the bedroom, locked themselves in, got
them on to a divan that was there, and began to disport them. <milestone id="p07030024" />And while thus
they sped the time, it chanced that the father returned, and, before any was ware of him,
was at the bedroom door, and knocked, and called the lady by her
name. <milestone id="p07030025" />Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">'Tis as much as my life is worth,</q> quoth Madonna Agnesa;
<q direct="unspecified">lo, here is my husband; and <pb n="127" />the occasion of our intimacy cannot but be now
apparent to him.</q> <milestone id="p07030026" /><q direct="unspecified">Sooth say you,</q> returned Fra Rinaldo, who was
undressed, that is to say, had thrown off his habit and hood, and was in his tunic; <q direct="unspecified">if
I had but my habit and hood on me in any sort, 'twould be another matter; but if you let
him in, and he find me thus, 'twill not be possible to put any face on it.</q>
<milestone id="p07030027" />But with an inspiration as happy as sudden: <q direct="unspecified">Now get them on you,</q> quoth
the lady; <q direct="unspecified">and when you have them on, take your godson in your arms, and give good heed
to what I shall say to him, that your words may accord with mine; and leave the rest to
me.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07030028" />The good man was still knocking, when his wife made answer:
<q direct="unspecified">Coming, coming.</q> And so up she got, and put on a cheerful
countenance and hied her to the door, and opened it and said: <q direct="unspecified">Husband mine: well indeed
was it for us that in came Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor; 'twas God that sent him to us; for in
sooth, but for that, we had to-day lost our boy.</q> <milestone id="p07030029" />Which the poor simpleton
almost swooned to hear; and: <q direct="unspecified">How so?</q> quoth he. <milestone id="p07030030" /><q direct="unspecified">O husband mine,</q>
replied the lady, <q direct="unspecified">he was taken but now, all of a sudden, with a fainting fit, so that I
thought he was dead: and what to do or say I knew not, had not Fra Rinaldo, our sponsor,
come just in the nick of time, and set him on his shoulder, and said: 'Gossip, 'tis that
he has worms in his body, and getting, as they do, about the heart, they might only too
readily be the death of him; but fear not; I will say a charm that will kill them all; and
before I take my leave, you will see your boy as whole as you ever saw him.'
<milestone id="p07030031" />And because to say certain of the prayers thou shouldst have been with us, and
the maid
knew not where to find thee, he caused his companion to say them at the top of the house,
and he and I came in here. <milestone id="p07030032" />And for that 'tis not meet for any but the boy's
mother to assist at such a service, that we might not be troubled with any one else, we
locked the door; and he yet has him in his arms; and I doubt not that he only waits till
his companion have said his prayers, and then the charm will be complete; for the boy is
already quite himself again.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07030033" />The good simple soul, taking all this for sooth,
and overwrought by the love he bore his son, was entirely without suspicion of the trick
his wife was playing him, and heaving a great sigh, said: <q direct="unspecified">I will go look for him.</q>
<milestone id="p07030034" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay,</q> replied the wife, <q direct="unspecified">go not: thou <pb n="128" />wouldst spoil the
efficacy of the charm: wait here; I will go see if thou mayst safely go; and will call
thee.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07030035" />Whereupon Fra Rinaldo, who had heard all that passed, and was in his
canonicals, and quite at his ease, and had the boy in his arms, having made sure that all
was as it should be, cried out: <q direct="unspecified">Gossip, do I not hear the father's voice out there?</q>
<milestone id="p07030036" /><q direct="unspecified">Ay indeed, Sir,</q> replied the simpleton. <milestone /><q direct="unspecified">Come in then,</q>
said Fra Rinaldo. So in came the simpleton. Whereupon quoth Fra Rinaldo: <q direct="unspecified">I restore to
you your boy made whole by the grace of God, whom but now I scarce thought you would see
alive at vespers. You will do well to have his image fashioned in wax, not less than
life-size, and set it for a thanksgiving to God, before the statue of Master St. Ambrose,
by whose merits you have this favour of God.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07030037" />The boy, catching sight of his
father, ran to him with joyous greetings, as little children are wont; and the father,
taking him in his arms, and weeping as if he were restored to him from the grave,
fell by turns a kissing him and thanking his godfather, that he had cured
him. <milestone id="p07030038" />Fra Rinaldo's companion, who had taught the maid not one paternoster only,
but peradventure four or more, and by giving her a little purse of white thread that a nun
had given him, had made her his devotee, no sooner heard Fra Rinaldo call the simpleton
into his wife's room, than he stealthily got him to a place whence he might see and hear
what was going on. Observing that the affair was now excellently arranged, he came down,
and entered the chamber, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Fra Rinaldo, those four prayers that you bade me say,
I have said them all.</q> <milestone id="p07030039" /><q direct="unspecified">Then well done, my brother,</q> quoth Fra Rinaldo,
<q direct="unspecified">well-breathed must thou be. For my part, I had but said two, when my gossip came in;
but what with thy
travail and mine, God of His grace has vouchsafed us the healing or the boy.</q>
<milestone id="p07030040" />The simpleton then had good wine and comfits brought in, and did the honours to
the godfather and his companion in such sort as their occasions did most demand. He then
ushered them forth of the house, commending them to God; and without delay had the waxen
image made, and directed it to be set up with the others in front of the statue of St.
Ambrose, not, be it understood, St. Ambrose of Milan.<note>The statue would doubtless be
that of St.  Ambrose of Siena, of the Dominican Order.</note></p></div2><pb n="129" /><div2 type="novella" who="lauretta" id="nov0704"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07040001" />Tofano one night locks his

	very well be understood. To which store I will

	understanding, and of such a sort that I know not by whom she could have been taught it
	save by Love.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p07040005" />Know, then, that there dwelt aforetime at Arezzo a rich man, Tofano
by name, who took to wife Monna Ghita, a lady exceeding fair, of whom, for what cause he
knew not, he presently grew jealous.  Whereof the lady being ware, waxed resentful, and
having on divers occasions demanded of him the reason of his jealousy, and gotten from him
nought precise, but only generalities and trivialities, resolved at last to give him cause
enough to die of that evil which without cause he so much dreaded. <milestone id="p07040006" />And being
ware that a gallant, whom she deemed well
<pb n="130" />worthy of her, was enamoured of her, she, using due discretion, came to an
understanding with him; which being brought to the point that it only remained to give
effect to their words in act, the lady cast about to devise how this might
be. <milestone id="p07040007" />And witting that, among other bad habits that her husband had, he was too
fond of his cups, she would not only commend indulgence, but cunningly and not seldom
incite him thereto; <milestone id="p07040008" />insomuch that, well-nigh as often as she was so minded, she
led him to drink to excess; and when she saw that he was well drunken, she would put him
to bed; and so not once only but divers times without any manner of risk she forgathered
with her lover; nay, presuming upon her husband's intoxication, she grew so bold that, not
content with bringing her lover into her house, she would at times go spend a great part
of the night with him at his house, which was not far off.</p><p><milestone id="p07040009" />Now such being the
enamoured lady's constant practice, it so befell that the dishonoured husband took note
that, while she egged him on to drink, she herself drank never a drop; whereby he came to
suspect the truth, to wit, that the lady was making him drunk, that afterwards she might
take her pleasure while he slept. <milestone id="p07040010" />And being minded to put his surmise to the
proof, one evening, having drunken nought all day, he mimicked never so drunken a sot both
in
speech and in carriage. The lady, deeming him to be really as he appeared, and that 'twas
needless to ply him with liquor, presently put him to bed.  Which done, she, as she at
times was wont, hied her forth to her lover's house, where she tarried until midnight.
<milestone id="p07040011" />Tofano no sooner perceived that his wife was gone, than up he got, hied him to
the door, locked it, and then posted himself at the window to observe her return, and let
her know that he was ware of her misconduct. So there he stood until the lady returned,
and finding herself locked out, was annoyed beyond measure, and sought to force the door
open. <milestone id="p07040012" />Tofano let her try her strength upon it a while, and then: <q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q>
quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">'tis all to no purpose: thou canst not get in. Go get thee back thither where
thou hast tarried all this while, and rest assured that thou shalt never recross this
threshold, until I have done thee such honour as is meet for thee in the presence of thy
kinsfolk and neighbours.</q> <milestone id="p07040013" />Thereupon the lady fell entreating him to be
pleased to open to her for the love of God, for that she was not come whence he supposed,
but had only been passing the time
<pb n="131" />with one of her gossips, because the nights were long, and she could not spend
the whole time either in sleep or in solitary watching.
But her supplications availed her nothing, for the fool was determined
that all Arezzo should know their shame, whereof as yet none wist aught.  <milestone id="p07040014" />So as
'twas idle to entreat, the lady assumed a menacing tone, saying: <q direct="unspecified">So thou open not to
me, I will make thee the saddest man alive.</q> <milestone id="p07040015" />Whereto Tofano made answer:
<q direct="unspecified">And what then canst thou do?</q> <milestone id="p07040016" />The lady, her wits sharpened by Love,
rejoined: <q direct="unspecified">Rather than endure the indignity to which thou wouldst unjustly subject me, I
will cast myself into the well hard by here, and when I am found dead there, all the world
will believe that 'twas thou that didst it in thy cups, and so thou wilt either have to
flee and lose all that thou hast and be outlawed, or forfeit thy head as guilty of my
death, as indeed thou wilt be.</q> <milestone id="p07040017" />But, for all she said, Tofano wavered not a
jot in his foolish purpose. So at last: <q direct="unspecified">Lo, now,</q> quoth the lady, <q direct="unspecified">I can no more
abide thy surly humour: God forgive thee: I leave thee my distaff here, which be careful
to bestow in a safe place.</q> <milestone id="p07040018" />So saying, away she hied her to the well, and,
the night being so dark that wayfarers could scarce see one another as they passed, she
took up a huge stone that was by the well, and ejaculating, <q direct="unspecified">God forgive me!</q> dropped
it therein. <milestone id="p07040019" />Tofano, hearing the mighty splash that the stone made as it struck
the water, never doubted that she had cast herself in: so, bucket and rope in hand, he
flung himself out of the house, and came running to the well to her rescue. <milestone id="p07040020" />The
lady had meanwhile hidden herself hard by the door, and seeing him make for the well, was
in the house in a trice, and having locked the door, hied her to the window, and greeted
him with: <q direct="unspecified">'Tis while thou art drinking, not now, when the night is far spent, that thou
shouldst temper thy wine with water.</q> <milestone id="p07040021" />Thus derided, Tofano came back to the
door, and finding his ingress barred, began adjuring her to let him
in. <milestone id="p07040022" />Whereupon, changing the low tone she had hitherto used for one so shrill
that 'twas well-nigh a shriek, she broke out with: <q direct="unspecified">By the Holy Rood, tedious drunken
sot that thou art, thou gettest no admittance here to-night; thy ways are more than I can
endure: 'tis time I let all the world know what manner of man thou art, and at what hour
of the night thou comest home.</q> <milestone id="p07040023" />Tofano, on his part, now grew angry, and
began loudly to upbraid her; insomuch that the neighbours, aroused by the noise, 
<pb n="132" />got up, men and women alike, and looked out of the windows, and asked what was the
matter. <milestone id="p07040024" />Whereupon the lady fell a weeping and saying: <q direct="unspecified">'Tis this wicked man,
who comes home drunk at even, or falls asleep in some tavern, and then returns at this
hour.  Long and to no purpose have I borne with him; but 'tis now past endurance, and I
have done him this indignity of locking him out of
the house in the hope that perchance it may cause him to mend his
ways.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07040025" />Tofano, on his part, told, dolt that he was, just what had happened, and
was mighty menacing. <milestone id="p07040026" />Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Now mark,</q> quoth the lady to the
neighbours, <q direct="unspecified">the sort of man he is!  What would you say if I were, as he is, in the
street, and he were in the house, as I am?  God's faith, I doubt you would believe what he
said. Hereby you may gauge his sense. He tells you that I have done just what, I doubt
not, he has done himself. <milestone id="p07040027" />He thought to terrify me by throwing I know not what
into the well, wherein would to God he had thrown himself indeed, and drowned himself,
whereby the wine of which he has taken more than enough, had
been watered to some purpose!</q> <milestone id="p07040028" />The neighbours, men and women alike, now with
one accord gave tongue, censuring Tofano, throwing all the blame upon him, and answering
what he alleged against the lady with loud recrimination; and in short the bruit, passing
from neighbour to neighbour, reached at last the ears of the lady's kinsfolk;
<milestone id="p07040029" />who hied them to the spot, and being apprised of the affair from this, that and
the other of the neighbours, laid hands on Tofano, and beat him till he was black and blue
from head to foot. Which done, they entered his house, stripped it of all that belonged to
the lady, and took her home with them, bidding Tofano look for worse to come.
<milestone id="p07040030" />Thus hard bested, and ruing the plight in which his jealousy had landed him,
Tofano, who loved his wife with all his heart, set some friends to work to patch matters
up, whereby he did in fact induce his lady to forgive him and live with him again; albeit
he was fain to promise her never again to be jealous, and to give her leave to amuse
herself to her heart's content, provided she used such discretion that he should not be
ware of it. <milestone id="p07040031" />On such wise, like the churl and booby that he was, being
despoiled, he made terms. Now long live

	and all had commended the lady, for that she had done well, and treated her caitiff

	ladies, the foregoing story prompts me likewise to discourse of one of these jealous
	husbands, deeming that they are justly requited by their wives, more especially when they
	grow jealous without due cause. And had our legislators taken account of everything, I am
	of opinion that they would have visited ladies in such a
	case with no other penalty than such as they provide for those that offend in
	self-defence, seeing that a jealous husband does cunningly practise against the life of
	his lady, and most assiduously machinate her death.  <milestone id="p07050004" />All the week the wife
	stays at home, occupied with her domestic duties; after which, on the day that is sacred
	to joy, she, like every one else, craves some solace, some peace, some recreation, not
	unreasonably, for she craves but what the husbandmen take in the fields, the craftsmen in
	the city, the magistrates in the courts, nay what God Himself took, when He rested from
	all His labours on the seventh day, and which laws human and Divine, mindful alike of the
	honour of God and the common well-being, have ordained, appropriating certain days to
	work, and others to repose. <milestone id="p07050005" />To which <pb n="134" />ordinance these jealous
	husbands will in no wise conform; on the contrary by then most sedulously secluding their
	wives, they make those days which to all other women are gladsome, to them most
	grievous and dolorous. And what an affliction it is to the poor creatures, they alone
	know, who have proved it; <milestone id="p07050006" />for which reason, to sum up, I say that a wife is
	rather to be commended than censured, if she take her revenge upon a husband that is
	jealous without cause.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p07050007" />Know then that at Rimini there dwelt a merchant, a man of
great substance in lands and goods and money, who, having a most beautiful woman to wife,
waxed inordinately jealous of her, and that for no better reason than that, loving her
greatly, and esteeming her exceeding fair, and knowing that she did her utmost endeavour
to pleasure him, he must needs suppose that every man loved her, and esteemed her fair,
and that she, moreover, was as zealous to stand well with every other man as with himself;
whereby you may see that he was a poor creature, and of little sense. <milestone id="p07050008" />Being
thus so deeply infected with jealousy, he kept so strict and close watch over her, that
some, maybe, have lain under sentence of death and been less
rigorously confined by their warders. <milestone id="p07050009" />'Twas not merely that the lady might not
go to a wedding, or a festal gathering, or even to church, or indeed set foot out of doors
in any sort; but she dared not so much as shew herself at a window, or cast a glance
outside the house, no matter for what purpose. Wherefore she led a most woeful life of it,
and found it all the harder to bear because she knew herself to be
innocent. <milestone id="p07050010" />Accordingly, seeing herself evilly entreated by her husband without
good cause, she cast about how for her own consolation she might devise means to justify
his usage of her. <milestone id="p07050011" />And for that, as she might not shew herself at the window,
there could be no interchange of amorous glances between her and any man that passed along
the street, but she wist that in the next house there was a goodly and debonair gallant,
she bethought her, that, if there were but a hole in the wall that divided the two houses,
she might watch
thereat, until she should have sight of the gallant on such wise that she might speak to
him, and give him her love, if he cared to have it, <milestone id="p07050012" />and, if so it might be
contrived, forgather with him now and again, and after this fashion relieve the burden of
her woeful life, until such time as the evil spirit should depart from her
husband. <milestone id="p07050013" />So peering about, now here, now there, when her husband was away, she
found <pb n="135" />in a very remote part of the house a place, where, by chance, the wall
had a little chink in it. Peering through which, she made out, though not without great
difficulty, that on the other side was a room, and said to herself: If this were Filippo's
room--Filippo was the name of the gallant, her neighbour--I should be already halfway to
my goal. <milestone id="p07050014" />So cautiously, through her maid, who was grieved to see her thus
languish, she made quest, and discovered that it was indeed the gallant's room, where he
slept quite alone. Wherefore she now betook her frequently to the aperture, and whenever
she was ware that the gallant was in the room, she would let fall a pebble or the like
trifle; whereby at length she brought the gallant to the other side of the aperture to see
what the matter was. <milestone id="p07050015" />Whereupon she
softly called him, and he knowing her voice, answered; and so, having now the opportunity
she had sought, she in few words opened to him all her mind. <milestone id="p07050016" />The gallant, being
overjoyed, wrought at the aperture on such wise that albeit none might be ware thereof, he
enlarged it; and there many a time they held converse together, and touched hands, though
further they might not go by reason of the assiduous watch that the jealous husband
kept.</p><p><milestone id="p07050017" />Now towards Christmas the lady told her husband that, if he
approved, she would fain go on Christmas morning to church, and confess and communicate,
like other Christians. <q direct="unspecified">And what sins,</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">hast thou committed, that
wouldst be shriven?</q> <milestone id="p07050018" /><q direct="unspecified">How?</q> returned the lady; <q direct="unspecified">dost thou take me for
a saint? For all thou keepest me so close, thou must know very well that I am like all
other mortals. However, I am not minded to confess to thee, for that thou art no
priest.</q> <milestone id="p07050019" />Her husband, whose suspicions were excited by what she had said,
cast about how he might discover these sins of hers, and having bethought him of what
seemed an apt expedient, made answer that she had his consent, but he would not have her
go to any church but their own chapel, where she might hie her betimes in the morning, and
confess either to their own chaplain or some other priest that the chaplain might assign
her, but to none other, and presently return to the house. The lady thought she half
understood him, but she answered only that she would do as he required.
<milestone id="p07050020" />Christmas morning came, and with the dawn the lady rose, dressed herself, and
hied her to the church appointed by her husband, who also rose, and hied him to the same
<pb n="136" />church, where he arrived before her; and having already concerted matters with
the priest that was in charge, he forthwith put on one of the priest's robes with a great
hood, overshadowing the face, such as we see priests wear, and which he pulled somewhat
forward; and so disguised he seated himself in the choir.</p><p><milestone id="p07050021" />On entering the church
the lady asked for the priest, who came, and learning that she was minded to confess, said
that he could not
hear her himself, but would send her one of his brethren; so away he hied him and sent
her, in an evil hour for him, her husband.  <milestone id="p07050022" />For though he wore an air of great
solemnity, and 'twas not yet broad day, and he had pulled the hood well over his eyes, yet
all did not avail, but that his lady forthwith recognized him, and said to herself: God be
praised! why, the jealous rogue is turned priest: but leave it me to give him that whereof
he is in quest. <milestone id="p07050023" />So she feigned not to know him, and seated herself at his
feet. (I should tell you that he had put some pebbles in his mouth, that his speech, being
impeded, might not betray him to his wife, and in all other respects he deemed himself so
thoroughly disguised that there was
nought whereby she might recognize him.) <milestone id="p07050024" />Now, to come to the confession, the
lady, after informing him that she was married, told him among other matters that she was
enamoured of a priest, who came every night to lie with her. <milestone id="p07050025" />Which to hear was
to her husband as if he were stricken through the heart with a knife; and had it not been
that he was bent on knowing more, he would have forthwith given over the confession, and
taken himself off. However he kept his place, and: <q direct="unspecified">How?</q> said he to the lady,
<q direct="unspecified">does not your husband lie with you?</q> <milestone id="p07050026" />The lady replied in the affirmative.
<milestone id="p07050027" /><q direct="unspecified">How, then,</q> quoth the husband, <q direct="unspecified">can the priest also lie with you?</q>
<milestone id="p07050028" /><q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> replied she, <q direct="unspecified">what art the priest employs I know not; but door
there is none, however well locked, in the house,
that comes not open at his touch; and he tells me that, being come to the door of my room,
before he opens it, he says certain words, whereby my husband forthwith falls asleep;
whereupon he opens the door, and enters the room, and lies with me; and so 'tis always,
without fail.</q> <milestone id="p07050029" /><q direct="unspecified">Then 'tis very wrong, Madam, and you must give it up
altogether,</q> said the husband. <milestone id="p07050030" /><q direct="unspecified">That, Sir,</q> returned the lady, <q direct="unspecified">I
doubt I can never do; for I love him too much.</q> <milestone id="p07050031" /><q direct="unspecified">In that case,</q> quoth
the husband, <q direct="unspecified">I cannot give you absolution.</q> <pb n="137" /><milestone id="p07050032" /><q direct="unspecified">The pity of
it!</q> ejaculated the lady; <q direct="unspecified">I came not hither to tell you falsehoods: if I could give
it up, I would.</q> <milestone id="p07050033" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> replied the husband, <q direct="unspecified">indeed I am sorry for
you; for I see that you are in a fair way to lose your soul. However, this I will do for
you; I will make special supplication to God on your behalf; and perchance you may be
profited thereby. And from time to time I will send you one of my young clerks; and you
will tell him whether my prayers have been of any help to you, or no, and if they have
been so, I shall know what to do next.</q> <milestone id="p07050034" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay, Sir,</q> quoth the lady,
<q direct="unspecified">do not so; send no man to me at home; for, should my husband come to know it, he is so
jealous that nothing in the world would ever disabuse him of the idea that he came but for
an evil
purpose, and so I should have no peace with him all the year long.</q>
<milestone id="p07050035" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> returned the husband, <q direct="unspecified">have no fear; rest assured that I will
so order matters that you shall never hear a word about it from him.</q> <milestone id="p07050036" /><q direct="unspecified">If
you can make sure of that,</q> quoth the lady, <q direct="unspecified">I have no more to say.</q> And so, her
confession ended, and her penance enjoined, she rose, and went to mass, <milestone id="p07050037" />while
the luckless husband, fuming and fretting, hasted to divest himself of his priest's
trappings, and then went home bent upon devising some means to bring the priest and his
wife together, and take his revenge upon them both.</p><p>When the lady came home
from church she read in her husband's face that she had spoiled his Christmas for him,
albeit he dissembled to the uttermost, lest she should discover what he had done, and
supposed himself to have learned. <milestone id="p07050038" />His mind was made up to keep watch for the
priest that very night by his own front door. So to the lady he said: <q direct="unspecified">I have to go out
to-night to sup and sleep; so thou wilt take care that the front door, and the mid-stair
door, and the bedroom door are well locked; and for the rest thou mayst go to bed, at
thine own time.</q> <milestone id="p07050039" /><q direct="unspecified">Well and good,</q> replied the lady: 
<milestone id="p07050040" />and as
soon as she was able, off she hied her to the aperture, and gave the wonted signal, which
Filippo no sooner heard, than he was at the spot. The lady then told him what she had done
in the morning, and what her husband had said to her after breakfast, adding: <q direct="unspecified">Sure I am
that he will not stir out of the house, but will keep watch beside the door; wherefore
contrive to come in to-night by the roof, that we may be together.</q>
<milestone id="p07050041" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> replied the gallant, nothing loath, <q direct="unspecified">trust me for that.</q></p><pb n="138" /><p><milestone id="p07050042" />Night came, the husband armed, and noiselessly hid himself in a room on the ground
floor: the lady locked all the doors, being especially careful to secure the mid-stair
door, to bar her husband's ascent; and in due time the gallant, having found his way
cautiously enough over the roof, they got them to bed, and there had solace of one another
and a good time; and at daybreak the gallant hied him back to his
house. <milestone id="p07050043" />Meanwhile the husband, rueful and supperless, half dead with cold, kept
his armed watch beside his door, momently expecting the priest, for the best part of the
night; but towards daybreak, his powers failing him, he lay down and slept in the
ground-floor room. <milestone id="p07050044" />'Twas hard upon tierce when he awoke, and the front door was
then open; so, making as if he had just come in, he went upstairs and breakfasted. Not
long afterwards he sent to his wife a young fellow, disguised as the priest's underling,
who asked her if he of whom she wist had been with her again. <milestone id="p07050045" />The lady, who
quite understood what that meant, made answer that he had not come that night, and that,
if he continued to neglect her so, 'twas possible he might be forgotten, though she had no
mind to forget him.</p><p><milestone id="p07050046" />Now, to make a long story short, the husband passed many a
night in the same way, hoping to catch the priest as he came in, the lady and her gallant
meanwhile having a good time. But at last the husband, being able to stand it no longer,
sternly demanded of his wife what she had said to the priest the morning when she was
confessed. The lady answered that she was not minded to tell him, for that 'twas not
seemly or proper so to do. <milestone id="p07050047" />Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Sinful woman,</q> quoth the husband,
<q direct="unspecified">in thy despite I know what thou saidst to him, and know I must and will who this priest
is, of whom thou art enamoured, and who by dint of his incantations lies with thee a
nights, or I will sluice thy veins for thee.</q> <milestone id="p07050048" /><q direct="unspecified">'Tis not true,</q> replied
the lady, <q direct="unspecified">that I am enamoured of a priest.</q> <milestone id="p07050049" /><q direct="unspecified">How?</q> quoth the
husband, <q direct="unspecified">saidst thou not as much to the priest that confessed thee?</q>
<milestone id="p07050050" /><q direct="unspecified">Thou canst not have had it from
him,</q> rejoined the lady. <q direct="unspecified">Wast thou then present thyself? For sure I never told him
so.</q> <milestone id="p07050051" /><q direct="unspecified">Then tell me,</q> quoth the husband, <q direct="unspecified">who this priest is; and lose
no time about it.</q> <milestone id="p07050052" />Whereat the lady began to smile, and: <q direct="unspecified">I find it not a
little diverting,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">that a wise man should suffer himself to be led by a
simple woman <pb n="139" />as a ram is led by the horns to the shambles; albeit no wise man
art thou: not since that fatal hour when thou gavest harbourage in thy breast, thou wist
not why, to the evil spirit of jealousy; and the more foolish and insensate thou art, the
less glory have I.  <milestone id="p07050053" />Deemest thou, my husband, that I am as blind of the bodily
eye as thou art of the mind's eye? Nay, but for sure I am not so.  I knew at a glance the
priest that confessed me, and that 'twas even thyself. But I was minded to give thee that
of which thou wast in quest, and I gave it thee. <milestone id="p07050054" />Howbeit, if thou hadst been
the wise man thou takest thyself to be, thou wouldst not have chosen such a way as that to
worm out thy good lady's secrets, nor wouldst thou have fallen a prey to a baseless
suspicion, but wouldst have understood that what she confessed was true, and she all the
while guiltless. <milestone id="p07050055" />I told thee that I loved a priest; and wast not thou, whom I
love, though ill enough dost thou deserve it, turned priest? I told thee that there was no
door in my house but would open when he was minded to lie with me: and when thou wouldst
fain have access to me, what door was ever closed against thee?  <milestone id="p07050056" />I told thee
that the priest lay nightly with me: and what night was there that thou didst not lie with
me? Thou sentest thy young clerk to me: and thou knowest that, as often as thou hadst not
been with me, I sent word that the priest had not been with me. <milestone id="p07050057" />Who but thou,
that hast suffered jealousy to blind thee, would have been so witless as not to read such
a riddle? But thou must needs mount guard at night beside the door, and think to make me
believe that thou hadst gone out to sup and sleep.  <milestone id="p07050058" />Consider thy ways, and
court not the mockery of those that know them as I do, but turn a man again as thou wast
wont to be: and let there be no more of this strict restraint in which thou keepest me;
for I swear to thee by God that, if I were minded to set horns on thy brow, I should not
fail so to take my pastime that thou wouldst never find it out, though thou hadst a
hundred eyes, as thou hast but two.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07050059" />Thus admonished, the jealous caitiff, who
had flattered himself that he had very cunningly discovered his wife's secret, was
ashamed, and made no answer save to commend his wife's wit and honour; and thus, having
cause for jealousy, he discarded it, as he <pb n="140" />had erstwhile been jealous without
cause.  And so the adroit lady had, as it were, a charter of indulgence, and needed no
more to contrive for her lover to come to her over the roof like a cat, but admitted him
by the door, and using due discretion, had many a good time with him, and sped her life
gaily.</p></div2><pb n="141" /><div2 type="novella" who="pampinea" id="nov0706"><head>Novel VI</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07060001" />Madonna Isabella has with her Leonetto, her

	again to demonstrate.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p07060004" />In our city, rich in all manner of good things, there dwelt a
young gentlewoman, fair exceedingly, and wedded to a most worthy and excellent
gentleman. <milestone id="p07060005" />And as it not seldom happens that one cannot keep ever to the same
diet, but would fain at times vary it, so this lady, finding her husband not altogether to
her mind, became enamoured of a gallant, Leonetto by name, who, though of no high rank,
was not a little debonair and courteous, and he in like manner
fell in love with her; and (as you know that 'tis seldom that what is
mutually desired fails to come about) 'twas not long before they had
fruition of their love. <milestone id="p07060006" />Now the lady being, as I said, fair and winsome,
it so befell that a gentleman, Messer Lambertuccio by name, grew mightily enamoured of
her, but so tiresome and odious did she <pb n="142" />find him, that for the world she could
not bring herself to love him.  So, growing tired of fruitlessly soliciting her favour by
ambassage, Messer Lambertuccio, who was a powerful signior, sent her at last another sort
of message in which he threatened to defame her if she complied not with his
wishes. Wherefore the lady, knowing her man, was terrified, and disposed herself to
pleasure him.</p><p><milestone id="p07060007" />Now it so chanced that Madonna Isabella, for such was the lady's
name, being gone, as is our Florentine custom in the summer, to spend some time on a very
goodly estate that she had in the contado, one morning finding herself alone, for her
husband had ridden off to tarry some days elsewhere, she sent for Leonetto to come and
keep her company; and Leonetto came forthwith in high glee. <milestone id="p07060008" />But while they were
together, Messer Lambertuccio, who, having got wind that the husband was away, had mounted
his horse and ridden thither quite alone, knocked at the door. <milestone id="p07060009" />Whereupon the
lady's maid hied her forthwith to her mistress, who was alone with Leonetto, and called
her, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, Messer Lambertuccio is here below, quite alone.</q>
<milestone id="p07060010" />Whereat the lady was vexed beyond measure; and being also not a little
dismayed, she said to Leonetto: <q direct="unspecified">Prithee, let it not irk thee to withdraw behind the
curtain, and there keep close until Messer Lambertuccio be gone.</q> <milestone id="p07060011" />Leonetto,
who stood in no less fear of Messer Lambertuccio than did the lady, got into his
hiding-place; and the lady bade the maid go open to Messer Lambertuccio: she did so; and
having dismounted and fastened his palfrey to a pin, he ascended the stairs; <milestone id="p07060012" />at
the head of which the lady received him with a smile and as gladsomea greeting as she
could find words for, and asked him on what errand he was come.  <milestone id="p07060013" />The gentleman
embraced and kissed her, saying: <q direct="unspecified">My soul, I am informed that your husband is not here,
and therefore I am come to stay a while with you.</q> Which said, they went into the room,
and locked them in, and Messer Lambertuccio fell a toying with her.</p><p><milestone id="p07060014" />Now, while thus
he sped the time with her, it befell that the lady's husband, albeit she nowise expected
him, came home, and, as he drew nigh the palace, was observed by the maid, who forthwith
ran to the lady's chamber, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, the master will be here anon; I doubt he is
already in the courtyard.</q> <milestone id="p07060015" />Whereupon, for that she had two men in the house,
and the knight's palfrey, that was in the courtyard, made it impossible to hide him, the
lady gave <pb n="143" />herself up for dead. Nevertheless she made up her mind on the spur
of the moment, and springing out of bed: <q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> quoth she to Messer Lambertuccio,
<q direct="unspecified">if you have any regard for me, and would save my life, you will do as I bid you:
<milestone id="p07060016" />that is to say, you will draw your blade, and put on a fell and wrathful
countenance, and hie you downstairs, saying: 'By God, he shall not escape me elsewhere.'
And if my husband would stop you, or ask you aught, say nought but what I have told you,
and get you on horseback and tarry with him on no account.</q> <milestone id="p07060017" /><q direct="unspecified">To hear is to
obey,</q> quoth Messer Lambertuccio, who, with the flush of his recent exertion and the
rage that he felt at the husband's return still on his face, and drawn sword in hand, did
as she bade him. The lady's husband, being now dismounted in the courtyard, and not a
little surprised to see the palfrey there, was about to go up the stairs, when he saw
Messer Lambertuccio coming down them, and marvelling both at his words and at
his mien: <q direct="unspecified">What means this, Sir?</q> quoth he. <milestone id="p07060018" />But Messer Lambertuccio
clapped foot in stirrup, and mounted, saying nought but: <q direct="unspecified">Zounds, but I will meet him
elsewhere;</q> and so he rode off.</p><p><milestone id="p07060019" />The gentleman then ascended the stairs, at the
head of which he found his lady distraught with terror, to whom he said: <q direct="unspecified">What manner of
thing is this? After whom goes Messer Lambertuccio, so wrathful and menacing?</q>
<milestone id="p07060020" />Whereto the lady, drawing nigher the room, that Leonetto might hear her, made
answer: <q direct="unspecified">Never, Sir, had I such a fright as this. There came running in here a young
man, who to me is quite a stranger, and at his heels Messer Lambertuccio with a drawn
sword in his hand; and as it happened the young man found the door of this room open, and
trembling in every limb, cried out: 'Madam, your succour, for God's sake, that I die not
in your arms.'  <milestone id="p07060021" />So up I got, and would have asked him who he was, and how
bested, when up came Messer Lambertuccio, exclaiming: 'Where art thou, traitor?' I planted
myself in the doorway, and kept him from entering, and seeing that I was not minded to
give him admittance, he was courteous enough, after not a little parley, to take himself
off, as you saw.</q> <milestone id="p07060022" />Whereupon:
<q direct="unspecified">Wife,</q> quoth the husband, <q direct="unspecified">thou didst very right. Great indeed had been the
scandal, had some one been slain here, and 'twas a gross affront on Messer Lambertuccio's
part to pursue a fugitive within the house.</q> He then asked where the young man
was. <milestone id="p07060023" />Whereto <pb n="144" />the lady answered: <q direct="unspecified">Nay, where he may be hiding,
Sir, I wot not.</q> <milestone id="p07060024" />So: <q direct="unspecified">Where art thou?</q> quoth the knight. <q direct="unspecified">Fear not to
shew thyself.</q> <milestone id="p07060025" />Then forth of his hiding-place, all of a tremble, for in
truth he had been thoroughly terrified, crept Leonetto, who had heard all that had passed.
<milestone id="p07060026" />To whom: <q direct="unspecified">What hast thou to do with Messer Lambertuccio?</q> quoth the
knight. <milestone id="p07060027" /><q direct="unspecified">Nothing in the world,</q> replied the young man: <q direct="unspecified">wherefore, I
doubt he must either be out of his mind, or have mistaken me for another; for no sooner
had he sight of me in the street hard by the palace, than he laid his hand on his sword,
and exclaimed: 'Traitor, thou art a dead man.'  Whereupon I sought not to know why,but
fled with all speed, and got me here, and so, thanks to God and this gentlewoman, I
escaped his hands.</q> <milestone id="p07060028" /><q direct="unspecified">Now away with thy fears,</q> quoth the knight; <q direct="unspecified">I
will see thee home safe and sound; and then 'twill be for thee to
determine how thou shalt deal with him.</q> <milestone id="p07060029" />And so, when they had supped, he
set him on horseback, and escorted him to Florence, and left him not until he was safe in
his own house. And the very same evening, following the lady's instructions, Leonetto
spoke privily with Messer Lambertuccio, and so composed the affair with him, that, though
it occasioned not a little talk, the knight never wist how he had been tricked by his
wife.</p></div2><pb n="145" /><div2 type="novella" who="filomena" id="nov0707"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07070001" />Lodovico discovers to Madonna

that there dwelt aforetime at Paris a Florentine gentleman, who, being by reason of
poverty turned merchant, had prospered so well in his affairs that he was become very
wealthy; and having by his lady an only son, Lodovico by name, <milestone id="p07070005" />whose nobility
disrelished trade, he would not put him in any shop;
but that he might be with other gentlemen, he caused him to enter the service of the King
of France, whereby he acquired very fine manners and other
accomplishments. <milestone id="p07070006" />Being in this service, Lodovico was one day with some other
young gallants that talked of the fair ladies of France, and England, and other parts of
the world, when they were joined by certain knights that were returned from the Holy
Sepulchre; and hearing their discourse, one of the knights fell a saying, that of a surety
in the whole world, so far as he had explored it, there was not any lady, of all that he
had ever seen, that might compare for beauty with Madonna Beatrice, the wife of Egano de'
Galluzzi, of Bologna: wherein all his companions, who
<pb n="146" />in common with him had seen the lady at Bologna, concurred.
<milestone id="p07070007" />Which report Lodovico, who was as yet fancy-free, no sooner heard, than he
burned with such a yearning to see the lady that he was able to think of nought else:
insomuch that he made up his mind to betake him to Bologna to see her, and if she pleased
him, to remain there; to which end he gave his father to understand that he would fain
visit the Holy Sepulchre, whereto his father after no little demur consented.</p><p><milestone id="p07070008" />So to
Bologna Anichino--for so he now called himself--came; and, as Fortune would have it, the
very next day, he saw the lady at a festal gathering, and deemed her vastly more beautiful
than he had expected: wherefore he waxed most ardently enamoured of her, and resolved
never to quit Bologna, until he had gained her love. <milestone id="p07070009" />So, casting about how he
should proceed, he could devise no other way but to enter her husband's service, which was
the more easy that he kept not a few retainers: on this wise Lodovico surmised that,
peradventure, he might compass his end. <milestone id="p07070010" />He therefore sold his horses and meetly
bestowed his servants, bidding them make as if they
knew him not; and being pretty familiar with his host, he told him that he was minded to
take service with some worthy lord, it any such he might find. <q direct="unspecified">Thou wouldst make,</q>
quoth the host, <q direct="unspecified">the very sort of retainer to suit a gentleman of this city, Egano by
name, who keeps not a few of them, and will have all of them presentable like thee: I will
mention the matter to him.</q> <milestone id="p07070011" />And so he accordingly did, and before he took
leave of Egano had placed Anichino with him, to Egano's complete satisfact ion.</p><p><milestone id="p07070012" />Being thus resident with Egano, and having abundant opportunities of seeing the fair
lady, Anichino set himself to serve Egano with no little zeal; wherein he succeeded so
well, that Egano was
more than satisfied, insomuch that by and by there was nought he could do without his
advice, and he entrusted to him the guidance not only of himself, but of all his
affairs. <milestone id="p07070013" />Now it so befell that one day when Egano was gone a hawking, having
left Anichino at home, Madonna Beatrice, who as yet wist not of his love, albeit she had
from time to time taken note of him and his manners, and had not a little approved and
commended them, sat herself down with him to a game of chess, which, to please her,
Anichino most dexterously contrived to lose, to the lady's prodigious delight.
<milestone id="p07070014" />After a while, the <pb n="147" />lady's women, one and all, gave over watching
their play, and left them to it; whereupon Anichino heaved a mighty sigh. <milestone id="p07070015" />The
lady, looking hard at him, said: <q direct="unspecified">What ails thee, Anichino? Is it, then, such a
mortification to thee to be conquered by me?</q> <milestone id="p07070016" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay, Madam,</q> replied
Anichino, <q direct="unspecified">my sigh was prompted by a much graver matter.</q> <milestone id="p07070017" /><q direct="unspecified">Then, if thou
hast any regard for me,</q> quoth the lady, <q direct="unspecified">tell me what it is.</q> <milestone id="p07070018" />Hearing
himself thus adjured by <q direct="unspecified">any regard</q> he had for her whom he loved more than aught
else, Anichino heaved a yet mightier sigh, which caused the lady to renew her
request that he would be pleased to tell her the occasion of his sighs.
Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> said Anichino, <q direct="unspecified">I greatly fear me, that, were I to tell it you,
'twould but vex you; and, moreover, I doubt you might repeat it to some one else.</q>
<milestone id="p07070019" /><q direct="unspecified">Rest assured,</q> returned the lady, <q direct="unspecified">that I shall neither be annoyed,
nor, without thy leave, ever repeat to any other soul aught that thou mayst say.</q>
<milestone id="p07070020" /><q direct="unspecified">Then,</q> said Anichino, <q direct="unspecified">having this pledge from you, I will tell it
you.</q> And, while the tears all but stood in his eyes, he told her, who he was, the
report he had heard of her, and where and how he had become enamoured of her, and with
what intent he had taken service with her husband: after which, he humbly besought her,
that, if it might be, she would have pity on him, and gratify this his secret and ardent
desire; and that, if she were not minded so to do, she would suffer him to retain his
place there, and love her. <milestone id="p07070021" />Ah! Bologna! how sweetly mixed are the elements in
thy women! How commendable in such a case are they all! No delight have they in sighs and
tears, but are ever inclinable to prayers, and ready to yield to the solicitations of
Love. Had I but words apt to praise them as they deserve, my eloquence were
inexhaustible.</p><p><milestone id="p07070022" />The gentlewoman's gaze was fixed on Anichino as he spoke; she made
no doubt that all he said was true, and yielding to his appeal, she entertained his love
within her heart in such measure that she too began to sigh, and after a sigh or two made
answer: <milestone id="p07070023" /><q direct="unspecified">Sweet my Anichino, be of good cheer; neither presents nor
promises, nor any courting by gentleman, or lord, or whoso else (for I have been and am
still courted by not a few) was ever able to sway my soul to love any of them: but thou,
by the few words that thou hast said, hast so wrought with me that, brief though the time
has been, I am already in far greater measure thine than mine. <milestone id="p07070024" />My love 
<pb n="148" />I deem thee to have won right worthily; and so I give it thee, and vow to give
thee joyance thereof before the coming night be past.  <milestone id="p07070025" />To which end thou wilt
come to my room about midnight; I will leave the door open; thou knowest the side of the
bed on which I sleep; thou wilt come there; should I be asleep, thou hast but to touch me,
and I shall awake, and give thee solace of thy long-pent desire. In earnest whereof I will
even give thee a kiss.</q> So saying, she threw her arms about his neck, and lovingly
kissed him, as Anichino her.</p><p><milestone id="p07070026" />Their colloquy thus ended, Anichino betook him
elsewhere about some matters which he had to attend to, looking forward to midnight with
boundless exultation. <milestone id="p07070027" />Egano came in from his hawking; and after supper, being
weary, went straight to bed, whither the lady soon followed him, leaving, as she had
promised, the door of the
chamber open. <milestone id="p07070028" />Thither accordingly, at the appointed hour, came Anichino, and
having softly entered the chamber, and closed the door behind him, stole up to where the
lady lay, and laying his hand upon her breast, found that she was awake. <milestone id="p07070029" />Now,
as soon as she wist that Anichino was come, she took his hand in both her own; and keeping
fast hold of him, she turned about in the bed, until she awoke Egano;
<milestone id="p07070030" />whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Husband,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">I would not say aught of this to thee,
yestereve, because I judged thou wast weary; but tell me, upon thy hope of salvation,
Egano, whom deemest thou thy best and most loyal retainer, and the most attached to
thee, of all that thou hast in the house?</q> <milestone id="p07070031" /><q direct="unspecified">What a question is this,
wife?</q> returned Egano. <q direct="unspecified">Dost not know him? Retainer I have none, nor ever had, so
trusted, or loved, as Anichino. But wherefore put such a question?</q></p><p><milestone id="p07070032" />Now, when
Anichino wist that Egano was awake, and heard them talk of himself, he more than once
tried to withdraw his hand,
being mightily afraid lest the lady meant to play him false; but she held it so tightly
that he might not get free, while thus she made answer to Egano: <milestone id="p07070033" /><q direct="unspecified">I will tell
thee what he is. I thought that he was all thou sayst, and that none was so loyal to thee
as he, but he has undeceived me, for that yesterday, when thou wast out a hawking, he,
being here, chose his time, and had the shamelessness to crave of me compliance with his
wanton desires: <milestone id="p07070034" />and I, that I might not need other evidence than that of thine
own senses to prove his guilt to thee, <pb n="149" />I made answer, that I was well content,
and that to-night, after midnight, I would get me into the garden, and await him there at
the foot of the pine. <milestone id="p07070035" />Now go thither I shall certainly not; but, if thou
wouldst prove the loyalty of thy retainer, thou canst readily do so, if thou but slip on
one of my loose robes, and cover thy face with a veil, and go down and attend his coming,
for come, I doubt not, he will.</q> <milestone id="p07070036" />Whereto Egano: <q direct="unspecified">Meet indeed it is,</q>
quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">that I should go see;</q> and straightway up he got, and, as best he might in
the dark, he put on one of the lady's loose robes and veiled his face, and then hied him
to the garden, and sate down at the foot of the pine to await Anichino. <milestone id="p07070037" />The
lady no sooner wist that he was out of the room, than she rose, and locked the
door. <milestone id="p07070038" />Anichino, who
had never been so terrified in all his life, and had struggled with all
his might to disengage his hand from the lady's clasp, and had inwardly cursed her and his
love, and himself for trusting her, a hundred thousand times, was overjoyed beyond measure
at this last turn that she had given the affair. And so, the lady having got her to bed
again, and he, at her bidding, having stripped and laid him down beside her, they had
solace and joyance of one another for a good while. <milestone id="p07070039" />Then, the lady, deeming it
unmeet for Anichino to tarry longer with her, caused him to get up and resume his clothes,
saying to him: <q direct="unspecified">Sweet my mouth, thou wilt take a stout cudgel,
and get thee to the garden, and making as if I were there, and thy suit to me had been but
to try me, thou wilt give Egano a sound rating with thy tongue and a sound belabouring
with thy cudgel, the sequel whereof will be wondrously gladsome and delightful.</q>
<milestone id="p07070040" />Whereupon Anichino hied him off to the garden, armed with a staff of wild
willow; and as he drew nigh the pine, Egano saw him, and rose and came forward to meet him
as if he would receive him with the heartiest of cheer. But: <q direct="unspecified">Ah! wicked woman!</q>
quoth Anichino; <q direct="unspecified">so thou art come! Thou didst verily believe, then, that I was, that I
am, minded thus to wrong my lord? Foul fall thee a
thousand times!</q> And therewith he raised his cudgel, and began to lay about
him. <milestone id="p07070041" />Egano, however, had heard and seen enough, and without a word took to
flight, while Anichino pursued him, crying out: <q direct="unspecified">Away with thee!  God send thee a bad
year, lewd woman that thou art; nor doubt that Egano shall hear of this to-morrow.</q>
<milestone id="p07070042" />Egano, having received sundry round knocks, got him back to his 
<pb n="150" />chamber with what speed he might; and being asked by the lady, whether Anichino
had come into the garden: <milestone id="p07070043" /><q direct="unspecified">Would to God he had not!</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">for
that, taking me for thee, he has beaten me black and blue with his cudgel, and rated me
like the vilest woman that ever was: passing strange, indeed, it had seemed to me that he
should have said those words to thee with intent to dishonour me;
and now 'tis plain that 'twas but that, seeing thee so blithe and
frolicsome, he was minded to prove thee.</q> <milestone id="p07070044" />Whereto: <q direct="unspecified">God be
praised,</q> returned the lady, <q direct="unspecified">that he proved me by words, as thee by
acts: and I doubt not he may say that I bear his words with more patience than thou his
acts. But since he is so loyal to thee, we must make much of him and do him honour.</q>
<milestone id="p07070045" /><q direct="unspecified">Ay, indeed,</q> quoth Egano, <q direct="unspecified">thou sayst sooth.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07070046" />Thus was Egano
fortified in the belief that never had any gentleman wife so true, or retainer so loyal,
as he; and many a hearty
laugh had he with Anichino and his lady over this affair, which to them was the occasion
that, with far less let than might else have been, they were able to have solace and
joyance of one another, so long as it pleased Anichino to tarry at Bologna.</p></div2><pb n="151" /><div2 type="novella" who="neifile" id="nov0708"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07080001" />A husband

then, that there dwelt aforetime in our
city a most wealthy merchant, Arriguccio Berlinghieri by name, who foolishly, as we wot by
daily experience is the way of merchants, thinking to compass gentility by matrimony, took
to wife a young gentlewoman, by no means suited to him, whose name was Monna
Sismonda. <milestone id="p07080005" />Now Monna Sismonda, seeing that her husband was much abroad, and gave
her little of his <pb n="152" />company, became enamoured of a young gallant, Ruberto by
name, who had long courted her: <milestone id="p07080006" />and she being grown pretty familiar with him,
and using, perchance, too little discretion, for she affected him extremely, it so befell
that Arriguccio, whether it was that he detected somewhat, or howsoever, waxed of all men
the most jealous, and gave up going abroad, and changed his way of life altogether, and
made it his sole care to watch over his wife, insomuch that he never allowed himself a
wink of sleep until he had seen her to bed: which occasioned the lady the most grievous
dumps, because 'twas on no wise possible for her to be with her Ruberto.  <milestone id="p07080007" />So,
casting about in many ways how she might contrive to meet him, and
being thereto not a little plied by Ruberto himself, she bethought her at last of the
following expedient: to wit, her room fronting the street, and Arriguccio, as she had
often observed, being very hard put to it to get him to sleep, but thereafter sleeping
very soundly, she resolved to arrange with Ruberto that he should come to the front door
about midnight, whereupon she would get her down, and open the door, and stay some time
with him while her husband was in his deep sleep. <milestone id="p07080008" />And that she might have
tidings of his arrival, yet so as that none else might wot aught thereof, she adopted the
device of lowering a pack-thread from the bedroom window on such wise that, while with one
end it should all but touch the ground, it should traverse the floor of the room, until it
reached the bed, and then be brought under the clothes, so that, when she was abed, she
might attach it to her great toe. <milestone id="p07080009" />Having so done, she sent word to Ruberto,
that when he came, he must be sure to jerk the pack-thread, and, if her husband were
asleep, she would loose it, and go open to him; but, if he were awake, she would hold it
taut and draw it to herself, to let him know that he must not expect
her. <milestone id="p07080010" />Ruberto fell in with the idea, came there many
times, and now forgathered with her and again did not. <milestone id="p07080011" />But at last, they still
using this cunning practice, it so befell that one night, while the lady slept,
Arriguccio, letting his foot stray more than he was wont about the bed, came upon the
pack-thread, and laying his hand upon it, found that it was attached to his lady's great
toe, and said to himself: This must be some trick: <milestone id="p07080012" />and afterwards discovering
that the thread passed out of the window, was confirmed in his surmise. Wherefore, he
softly severed it from the lady's toe, and <pb n="153" />affixed it to his own; and waited,
all attention, to learn the result of his experiment. <milestone id="p07080013" />Nor had he long to wait
before Ruberto came, and Arriguccio felt him jerk the thread according to his wont: and as
Arriguccio had not known how to attach the thread securely, and Ruberto jerked it with
some force, it gave way, whereby he understood that he was to wait, and did
so. <milestone id="p07080014" />Arriguccio straightway arose, caught up his arms, and hasted to the door to
see who might be there, intent to do him a mischief. Now Arriguccio, for all he was a
merchant, was a man of spirit, and of thews and sinews; and being
come to the door, he opened it by no means gingerly, as the lady was wont; whereby
Ruberto, who was in waiting, surmised the truth, to wit, that 'twas Arriguccio by whom the
door was opened.  Wherefore he forthwith took to flight, followed by
Arriguccio. <milestone id="p07080015" />But at length, when he had run a long way, as Arriguccio gave not
up the pursuit, he being also armed, drew his sword, and faced about; and so they fell to,
Arriguccio attacking, and Ruberto defending himself.</p><p><milestone id="p07080016" />Now when Arriguccio undid the
bedroom door, the lady awoke, and finding the pack-thread cut loose from her toe, saw at a
glance that her trick was discovered; and hearing Arriguccio running after Ruberto, she
forthwith got up, foreboding what the result was like to be, and called her maid, who was
entirely in her confidence:
whom she so plied with her obsecrations that at last she got her into bed in her room,
beseeching her not to say who she was, but to bear patiently all the blows that Arriguccio
might give her; and she would so reward her that she should have no reason to complain.
<milestone id="p07080017" />Then, extinguishing the light that was in the room, forth she hied her, and
having found a convenient hiding-place in the house, awaited the turn of
events. <milestone id="p07080018" />Now Arriguccio and Ruberto being hotly engaged in the street, the
neighbours, roused by the din of the combat, got up and launched their curses upon
them. Wherefore
Arriguccio, fearing lest he should be recognized, drew off before he had so much as
discovered who the young gallant was, or done him any scathe, and in a fell and wrathful
mood betook him home.  Stumbling into the bedroom, he cried out angrily: <q direct="unspecified">Where art
thou, lewd woman? Thou hast put out the light, that I may not be able to find thee; but
thou hast miscalculated.</q> <milestone id="p07080019" />And going to the bedside, he laid hold of the
maid, taking her to be his wife, <pb n="154" />and fell a pummelling and kicking her with
all the strength he had in his hands and feet, insomuch that he pounded her face well-nigh
to pulp, rating her the while like the vilest woman that ever was; and last of all he cut
off her hair. <milestone id="p07080020" />The maid wept bitterly, as indeed she well might; and though from
time to time she ejaculated an <q direct="unspecified">Alas! Mercy, for God's sake!</q> or <q direct="unspecified">Spare me, spare
me;</q> yet her voice was so broken by her sobs, and Arriguccio's hearing so dulled by his
wrath, that he was not able to discern that 'twas not
his wife's voice but that of another woman. <milestone id="p07080021" />So, having soundly thrashed her,
and cut off her hair, as we said: <q direct="unspecified">Wicked woman,</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">I touch thee no more;
but I go to find thy brothers, and shall do them to wit of thy good works; and then they
may come here, and deal with thee as they may deem their honour demands, and take thee
hence, for be sure thou shalt no more abide in this house.</q> With this he was gone,
locking the door of the room behind him, and quitted the house alone.</p><p><milestone id="p07080022" />Now no sooner
did Monna Sismonda, who had heard all that passed, perceive that her husband was gone,
than she opened the door of the bedroom, rekindled the light, and finding her maid all
bruises and tears, did what she could to comfort her, and carried her back to her own
room, where, causing her to be privily waited on and tended, she helped her so liberally
from Arriguccio's own store, that she confessed herself content. <milestone id="p07080023" />The maid thus
bestowed in her room, the lady presently hied her back to her own, which she set all in
neat and trim order, remaking the bed, so that it might
appear as if it had not been slept in, relighting the lamp, and dressing
and tiring herself, until she looked as if she had not been abed that
night; then, taking with her a lighted lamp and some work, she sat her down at the head of
the stairs, and began sewing, while she waited to see how the affair would end.</p><p><milestone id="p07080024" />Arriguccio meanwhile had hied him with all speed straight from the house to that of his
wife's brothers, where by dint of much knocking he made himself heard, and was
admitted. The lady's
three brothers, and her mother, being informed that 'twas Arriguccio, got up, and having
set lights a burning, came to him and asked him on what errand he was come there at that
hour, and alone. <milestone id="p07080025" />Whereupon Arriguccio, beginning with the discovery of the
pack-thread attached to his lady's great toe, gave them the whole <pb n="155" />narrative of
his discoveries and doings down to the very end; and to clinch the whole matter, he put in
their hands the locks which he had cut, as he believed, from his wife's head, adding that
'twas now for them to come for her and deal with her on such wise as they might deem their
honour required, seeing that he would nevermore have her in his house. <milestone id="p07080026" />Firmly
believing what he told them, the lady's brothers were very wroth with her, and having
provided themselves with lighted torches, set out with Arriguccio, and hied them to his
house with intent to scorn her, <milestone id="p07080027" />while their mother followed, weeping and
beseeching now one, now another, not to credit these matters so hastily, until they had
seen or heard somewhat more thereof; for that the husband might have some other reason to
be wroth with her, and having ill-treated her, might have trumped up this charge by way of
exculpation, adding that, if true, 'twas passing strange, for well she knew her daughter,
whom she had brought up from her tenderest years, and much more to the like
effect.</p><p><milestone id="p07080028" />However, being come to Arriguccio's house, they entered, and were mounting
the stairs, when Monna Sismonda, hearing them, called out: <q direct="unspecified">Who is there?</q>
<milestone id="p07080029" />Whereto one of the brothers responded: <q direct="unspecified">Lewd woman, thou shalt soon have
cause enough to know who it is.</q> <milestone id="p07080030" /><q direct="unspecified">Now Lord love us!</q> quoth Monna
Sismonda, <q direct="unspecified">what would he be at?</q> Then, rising, she greeted them with: <q direct="unspecified">Welcome, my
brothers; but what seek ye abroad at this hour, all three of you?</q> <milestone id="p07080031" />They had
seen her sitting and sewing with never a sign of a blow on her face, whereas Arriguccio
had averred that he had pummelled her all over: wherefore their first impression was one
of wonder, and refraining the vehemence of their wrath, they asked her what might be the
truth of the matter which Arriguccio
laid to her charge, and threatened her with direful consequences, if she should conceal
aught. <milestone id="p07080032" />Whereto the lady: <q direct="unspecified">What you would have me tell you,</q> quoth she,
<q direct="unspecified">or what Arriguccio may have laid to my charge, that know not I.</q> Arriguccio could
but gaze upon her, as one that had taken leave of his wits, calling to mind how he had
pummelled her about the face times without number, and scratched it for her, and
mishandled her in all manner of ways, and there he now saw her with no trace of aught of
it all upon her. <milestone id="p07080033" />However, to make a long story short, the lady's brothers told
her what Arriguccio <pb n="156" />had told them touching the pack-thread and the beating and
all the rest of it. <milestone id="p07080034" />Whereupon the lady turned to him with: <q direct="unspecified">Alas, my husband,
what is this that I hear? Why givest thou me, to thy own great shame, the reputation of a
lewd woman, when such I am not, and thyself the reputation of a wicked and cruel man,
which thou art not? Wast thou ever to-night, I say not in my company, but so much as in
the house until now? Or when didst thou beat me?  For my part I mind me not of it.</q>
<milestone id="p07080035" />Arriguccio began: <q direct="unspecified">How sayst thou, lewd woman? Did we not go to bed together?
Did I not come back, after chasing thy lover? Did I not give thee bruises not a few, and
cut thy hair for thee?</q> <milestone id="p07080036" />But the lady interrupted him, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Nay, thou
didst not lie here to-night. But leave we this, of which my true words are my sole
witness, and pass we to this of the beating thou sayst thou gavest me, and how thou didst
cut my hair. <milestone id="p07080037" />Never a beating had I from thee, and I bid all that are here, and
thee among them, look at me, and say if I have any trace of a beating on my person; nor
should I advise thee to dare lay hand upon me; for, by the Holy Rood, I would spoil thy
beauty for thee. <milestone id="p07080038" />Nor didst thou cut my hair, for aught that I saw or felt:
however, thou didst it, perchance, on such wise that I was not ware thereof: so let me see
whether 'tis cut or no.</q> Then, unveiling herself, she shewed that her hair was uncut
and entire. <milestone id="p07080039" />Wherefore her brothers and mother now turned to Arriguccio with:
<q direct="unspecified">What means this, Arriguccio? This accords not with what thou gavest us
to understand thou hadst done; nor know we how thou wilt prove the residue.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07080040" />Arriguccio was lost, as it were, in a dream, and yet he would fain have spoken; but,
seeing that what he had thought to prove was
otherwise, he essayed no reply. <milestone id="p07080041" />So the lady turning to her brothers: <q direct="unspecified">I
see,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">what he would have: he will not be satisfied unless I do what I
never would otherwise have done, to wit, give you to know what a pitiful caitiff he is; as
now I shall not fail to do.  I make no manner of doubt that, as he has said, even so it
befell, and so he did. How, you shall hear. <milestone id="p07080042" />This worthy man, to whom, worse
luck! you gave me to wife, a merchant, as he calls himself, and as such would fain have
credit, and who ought to be more temperate than a religious, and more continent than a
girl, lets scarce an evening pass but he goes a boozing in the taverns, and consorting 
<pb n="157" />with this or the other woman of the town; and 'tis for me to await his return
until midnight or sometimes until matins, even as you now find me. <milestone id="p07080043" />I doubt not
that, being thoroughly well drunk, he got him to bed with one of these wantons, and,
awaking, found the packthread on her foot, and afterwards did actually perform all these
brave exploits of which he speaks, and in the end came back to her, and
beat her, and cut her hair off, and being not yet quite recovered from his debauch,
believed, and, I doubt not, still believes, that 'twas I that he thus treated; and if you
will but scan his face closely, you will see that he is still half drunk. <milestone id="p07080044" />But,
whatever he may have said about me, I would have you account it as nothing more than the
disordered speech of a tipsy man; and forgive him as I do.</q> <milestone id="p07080045" />Whereupon the
lady's mother raised no small outcry, saying: <q direct="unspecified">By the Holy Rood, my daughter, this may
not be! A daughter, such as thou, to be mated with one so unworthy of thee! The pestilent,
insensate cur should be slain on the spot! A pretty state of things, indeed! Why, he might
have picked thee up from the gutter! <milestone id="p07080046" />Now foul fall him!  but thou shalt no more
be vexed with the tedious drivel of a petty dealer in ass's dung, some blackguard, belike,
that came hither from the country because he was dismissed the service of some petty
squire, clad in romagnole, with belfry-breeches, and a pen in his arse, and, for that he
has a few pence, must needs have a gentleman's daughter,
and a fine lady to wife, and set up a coat of arms, and say: <milestone id="p07080047" />'I am of the such
and such,' and 'my ancestors did thus and thus.' Ah!  had my sons but followed my advice!
Thy honour were safe in the house of the Counts Guidi, where they might have bestowed
thee, though thou hadst but a morsel of bread to thy dowry: but they must needs give thee
to this rare treasure, who, though better daughter and more chaste there is none than thou
in Florence, has not blushed this very midnight and in our presence to call thee a
strumpet, as if we knew thee not. God's faith! so I were hearkened
to, he should shrewdly smart for it.</q> <milestone id="p07080048" />Then, turning to her sons, she said:
<q direct="unspecified">My sons, I told you plainly enough that this ought not to be.  Now, have you heard how
your worthy brother-in-law treats your sister?  Petty twopenny trader that he is: were it
for me to act, as it is for you, after what he has said of her and done to her, nought
would satisfy or appease me, till I had rid the earth of him. And were I a man, who am but
a woman, none other but <pb n="158" />myself should meddle with the affair.  God's curse
upon him, the woeful, shameless sot!</q> <milestone id="p07080049" />Whereupon the young men, incensed by
what they had seen and heard, turned to Arriguccio, and after giving him the soundest
rating that ever was bestowed upon caitiff, concluded as follows: <q direct="unspecified">This once we pardon
thee, witting thee to be a drunken knave: but as thou holdest thy life dear, have a care
that
henceforth we hear no such tales of thee; for rest assured that if aught of the kind do
reach our ears, we will requite thee for both turns.</q> Which said, they
departed. <milestone id="p07080050" />Arriguccio, standing there like one dazed, not witting whether his
late doings were actual fact or but a dream, made no more words about the matter, but left
his wife in peace. Thus did she by her address not only escape imminent peril, but open a
way whereby in time to come she was able to gratify her passion to the full without any
farther fear of her husband.</p></div2><pb n="159" /><div2 type="novella" who="panfilo" id="nov0709"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07090001" />Lydia, wife of

	though it has been in stories not a few, I purpose to afford you yet more signal proof in

	far more to the favour of Fortune than to the guidance of reason: <milestone id="p07090004" />wherefore I
	should not advise any of you rashly to follow in her footsteps, seeing
	that Fortune is not always in a kindly mood, nor are the eyes of all men equally
	holden.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p07090005" />In Argos, that most ancient city of Achaia, the fame of whose kings of old
time is out of all proportion to its size, there dwelt of yore Nicostratus, a nobleman, to
whom, when he was already verging on old age, Fortune gave to wife a great lady, Lydia by
name, whose courage matched her charms. <milestone id="p07090006" />Nicostratus, as suited with his rank
and wealth, kept not a few retainers and hounds and hawks, and was
mightily addicted to the chase. Among his dependants was a young man named Pyrrhus, a
gallant of no mean accomplishment, and goodly of person and beloved and trusted by
Nicostratus above all <pb n="160" />other. <milestone id="p07090007" />Of whom Lydia grew mighty enamoured,
insomuch that neither by day nor by night might her thoughts stray from him: but, whether
it was that Pyrrhus wist not her love, or would have none of it, he gave no sign of
recognition; whereby the lady's suffering waxing more than she could bear, <milestone id="p07090008" />she
made up her mind to declare her love to him; and having a chambermaid, Lusca by name, in
whom she placed great trust, she called her, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Lusca,
tokens thou hast had from me of my regard that should ensure thy obedience and loyalty;
wherefore have a care that what I shall now tell thee reach the ears of none but him to
whom I shall bid thee impart it. <milestone id="p07090009" />Thou seest, Lusca, that I am in the prime of
my youth and lustihead, and have neither lack nor stint of all such things as folk desire,
save only, to be brief, that I have one cause to repine, to wit, that my husband's years
so far outnumber my own. <milestone id="p07090010" />Wherefore with that wherein young ladies take most
pleasure I am but ill provided, and, as my desire is no less than theirs, 'tis now some
while since I determined that, if Fortune has shewn herself so little friendly to me by
giving me a husband so advanced in years, at least I will not be mine own enemy by sparing
to devise the means whereby my happiness and health may be assured; <milestone id="p07090011" />and that
herein, as in all other
matters, my joy may be complete, I have chosen, thereto to minister by his embraces, our
Pyrrhus, deeming him more worthy than any other man, and have so set my heart upon him
that I am ever ill at ease save when he is present either to my sight or to my mind,
insomuch that, unless I forgather with him without delay, I doubt not that 'twill be the
death of me. <milestone id="p07090012" />And so, if thou holdest my life dear, thou wilt shew him my love
on such wise as thou mayst deem best, and make my suit to him that he be pleased to come
to me, when thou shalt go to fetch him.</q> <milestone id="p07090013" /><q direct="unspecified">That gladly will I,</q> replied
the chambermaid; and as soon as she found convenient time and place, she drew Pyrrhus
apart, and, as best she knew how, conveyed her lady's message to him. Which Pyrrhus found
passing strange to hear, for 'twas in truth a complete surprise to him, and he doubted
the lady did but mean to try him. Wherefore he presently, and with some asperity, answered
thus: <milestone id="p07090014" /><q direct="unspecified">Lusca, believe I cannot that this message comes from my lady: have a
care, therefore, what thou sayst, and if, perchance, it does come from her, I doubt she
does not mean it; and if, perchance, she does mean it, why, then I am <pb n="161" />honoured
by my lord above what I deserve, and I would not for my life do him such a wrong: so have
a care never to speak of such matters to me again.</q> <milestone id="p07090015" />Lusca, nowise
disconcerted by his uncompliant tone, rejoined: <q direct="unspecified">I shall speak to thee, Pyrrhus, of
these and all other matters, wherewith I may be commissioned by my lady, as often as she
shall bid me, whether it pleases or irks thee; but thou art a blockhead.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07090016" />So,
somewhat chafed, Lusca bore Pyrrhus' answer back to her lady, who would fain have died,
when she heard it, and some days afterwards resumed the topic, saying: <milestone id="p07090017" /><q direct="unspecified">Thou
knowest, Lusca, that 'tis not the first stroke that fells the oak; wherefore, methinks,
thou wert best go back to this strangeman, who is minded to evince his loyalty at my
expense, and choosing a convenient time, declare to him all my passion, and do thy best
endeavour that the affair be carried through; for if it should thus lapse, 'twould be the
death of me; besides which, he would think we had but trifled with him, and, whereas 'tis
his love we would have, we should earn his hatred.</q> <milestone id="p07090018" />So, after comforting the
lady, the maid hied her in quest of Pyrrhus,
whom she found in a gladsome and propitious mood, and thus addressed: <q direct="unspecified">'Tis not many
days, Pyrrhus, since I declared to thee how ardent is the flame with which thy lady and
mine is consumed for love of thee, and now again I do thee to wit thereof, and that, if
thou shalt not relent of the harshness that thou didst manifest the other day, thou mayst
rest assured that her life will be short: wherefore I pray thee to be pleased to give her
solace of her desire, and shouldst thou persist in thy obduracy, I, that gave thee credit
for not a little sense, shall deem thee a great fool. <milestone id="p07090019" />How flattered thou
shouldst be to know thyself beloved above all else by a lady so beauteous and high-born!
<milestone id="p07090020" />And how indebted shouldst thou feel thyself to Fortune, seeing that she has in
store for thee a boon so great and so suited to the cravings of thy youth, ay, and so like
to be of service to thee upon occasion of need! <milestone id="p07090021" />Bethink thee, if there be any
of thine equals whose life is ordered more agreeably than thine will be if thou but be
wise. Which of them wilt thou find so well furnished with arms and horses, clothes and
money as thou shalt be, if thou but give my lady thy love? <milestone id="p07090022" />Receive, then, my
words with open mind; be thyself again; bethink thee that 'tis Fortune's way to confront a
man but once with smiling mien and open lap, and, if he <pb n="162" />then accept not her
bounty, he has but himself to blame, if afterward he find himself in want, in
beggary. <milestone id="p07090023" />Besides which, no such loyalty is demanded between servants and their
masters as between friends and kinsfolk; rather 'tis for servants, so far as they may, to
behave towards their masters as their masters behave towards them. <milestone id="p07090024" />Thinkest
thou, that, if thou hadst a fair wife or mother or daughter or sister that found favour in
Nicostratus' eyes, he would be so scrupulous on the point of loyalty as thou art disposed
to be in regard of his lady?  <milestone id="p07090025" />Thou art a fool, if so thou dost believe. Hold it
for certain, that, if blandishments and supplications did not suffice, he would, whatever
thou mightest think of it, have recourse to force. <milestone id="p07090026" />Observe we, then, towards
them and theirs the same rule which they observe towards us and ours. Take the boon that
Fortune offers thee; repulse her not; rather go thou to meet her, and hail her advance;
for be sure that, if thou do not so, to say nought of thy lady's death, which will
certainly ensue, thou thyself wilt repent thee thereof so often that
thou wilt be fain of death.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07090027" />Since he had last seen Lusca, Pyrrhus had
repeatedly pondered what she had said to him, and had made his mind up that, should she
come again, he would answer her in another sort, and comply in all respects with the
lady's desires, provided he might be assured that she was not merely putting him to the
proof; <milestone id="p07090028" />wherefore he now made answer: <q direct="unspecified">Lo, now, Lusca, I acknowledge the truth
of all that thou
sayst; but, on the other hand, I know that my lord is not a little wise and wary, and, as
he has committed all his affairs to my charge, I sorely misdoubt me that 'tis with his
approbation, and by his advice, and but to prove me, that Lydia does this:
<milestone id="p07090029" />wherefore let her do three things which I shall demand of her for my assurance,
and then there is nought that she shall crave of me, but I will certainly render her
prompt obedience. <milestone id="p07090030" />Which three things are these: first, let her in Nicostratus'
presence kill his fine sparrow-hawk: then she must send me a lock of Nicostratus' beard,
and lastly one of his best teeth.</q> <milestone id="p07090031" />Hard seemed these terms to Lusca, and
hard beyond measure to the lady, but Love, that great fautor of enterprise, and master of
stratagem, gave her resolution to address herself to their performance: wherefore through
the chambermaid she sent him word that what he required of her she would do, and that
without either reservation or delay; and therewithal she told him, that, as he deemed
Nicostratus so wise, she <pb n="163" />would contrive that they should enjoy one another in
Nicostratus' presence, and that Nicostratus should believe that 'twas a mere show.
<milestone id="p07090032" />Pyrrhus, therefore, anxiously expected what the lady would do. Some days thus
passed, and then Nicostratus gave a great breakfast, as was his frequent wont, to certain
gentlemen, and when the tables were removed, the lady, robed in green samite, and richly
adorned, came forth of her chamber into the hall wherein they sate, and before the eyes of
Pyrrhus and all the rest of the company hied her to the perch, on which stood the
sparrow-hawk that Nicostratus so much prized, and loosed him, and, as if she were minded
to carry him on her hand, took him by the jesses and dashed him against the wall so that
he died. <milestone id="p07090033" />Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Alas! my lady, what hast thou done?</q> exclaimed
Nicostratus: but she vouchsafed no answer, save that,
turning to the gentlemen that had sate at meat with him, she said: <q direct="unspecified">My lords, ill fitted
were I to take vengeance on a king that had done me despite, if I lacked the courage to be
avenged on a sparrowhawk.  <milestone id="p07090034" />You are to know that by this bird I have long been
cheated of all the time that ought to be devoted by gentlemen to pleasuring their ladies;
for with the first streaks of dawn Nicostratus has been up and got him to horse, and hawk
on hand hied him to the champaign to see him fly, leaving me, such as you see me, alone
and ill content abed. <milestone id="p07090035" />For which cause I have oftentimes been minded to do that
which I have now done, and have only refrained therefrom, that, biding my time, I might do
it in the presence of men that should judge my cause justly, as I trust you will do.</q>
<milestone id="p07090036" />Which hearing, the gentlemen, who deemed her affections no less fixed on
Nicostratus than her words imported, broke with one accord into a laugh,
and turning to Nicostratus, who was sore displeased, fell a saying: <q direct="unspecified">Now well done of
the lady to avenge her wrongs by the death of the sparrow-hawk!</q> and so, the lady being
withdrawn to her chamber, they passed the affair off with divers pleasantries, turning the
wrath of Nicostratus to laughter.</p><p><milestone id="p07090037" />Pyrrhus, who had witnessed what had passed, said
to himself: Nobly indeed has my lady begun, and on such wise as promises well for the
felicity of my love. God grant that she so continue.  <milestone id="p07090038" />And even so Lydia did:
for not many days after she had killed the
sparrow-hawk, she, being with Nicostratus in her chamber, from caressing passed to toying
and trifling with him, and he, sportively <pb n="164" />pulling her by the hair, gave her
occasion to fulfil the second of
Pyrrhus' demands; which she did by nimbly laying hold of one of the lesser tufts of his
beard, and, laughing the while, plucking it so hard that she tore it out of his
chin. <milestone id="p07090039" />Which Nicostratus somewhat resenting: <q direct="unspecified">Now what cause hast thou,</q>
quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">to make such a wry face? 'Tis but that I have plucked some half-dozen hairs
from thy beard. Thou didst not feel it as much as did I but now thy tugging of my
hair.</q> <milestone id="p07090040" />And so they continued jesting and sporting with one another, the lady
jealously guarding the tuft that she had torn from the beard, which the very same day she
sent to her cherished lover. <milestone id="p07090041" />The third demand caused the lady more thought;
but, being amply endowed with wit, and powerfully seconded
by Love, she failed not to hit upon an apt expedient.</p><p><milestone id="p07090042" />Nicostratus had in his service two lads, who, being of gentle birth, had been placed
with him by their kinsfolk, that they might learn manners, one of whom, when Nicostratus
sate at meat, carved before him, while the other gave him to drink. Both lads Lydia called
to her, and gave them to understand that their breath smelt, and admonished them that,
when they waited on Nicostratus, they should hold their heads as far back as possible,
saying never a word of the matter to any. <milestone id="p07090043" />The lads believing her, did as she
bade them. Whereupon she took occasion to say to Nicostratus: <q direct="unspecified">Hast thou marked what
these lads do when they wait upon thee?</q> <milestone id="p07090044" /><q direct="unspecified">Troth, that have I,</q> replied
Nicostratus; <q direct="unspecified">indeed I have often had it in mind to ask them why they do so.</q>
<milestone id="p07090045" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay,</q> rejoined the lady, <q direct="unspecified">spare thyself the pains; for I can tell thee
the reason, which I have for some time kept close, lest it should vex thee; but as I now
see that others begin to be ware of it, it need no longer be withheld from
thee. <milestone id="p07090046" />'Tis for that thy breath stinks shrewdly that they thus avert their heads
from thee: 'twas not wont to be so, nor know I why it should be so; and 'tis most
offensive when thou art in converse with gentlemen; and therefore 'twould be well to find
some way of curing it.</q> <milestone id="p07090047" /><q direct="unspecified">I wonder what it could be,</q> returned
Nicostratus; <q direct="unspecified">is it perchance that I have a decayed tooth in my jaw?</q>
<milestone id="p07090048" /><q direct="unspecified">That may well be,</q> quoth Lydia: and taking him to a window, she caused
him open his mouth, and after regarding it on this side and that: <milestone id="p07090049" /><q direct="unspecified">Oh!
Nicostratus,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">how couldst thou have endured it so long? Thou hast a tooth
here, <pb n="165" />which, by what I see, is not only decayed, but actually rotten
throughout; and beyond all manner of doubt, if thou let it remain long in thy head, 'twill
infect its neighbours; so 'tis my advice that thou out with it before the matter grows
worse.</q> <milestone id="p07090050" /><q direct="unspecified">My judgment jumps with thine,</q> quoth Nicostratus; <q direct="unspecified">wherefore
send without delay for a chirurgeon to draw it.</q> <milestone id="p07090051" /><q direct="unspecified">God forbid,</q> returned
the lady, <q direct="unspecified">that chirurgeon come hither for such a purpose; methinks, the case is such
that I can very well dispense with him, and draw the tooth myself. <milestone id="p07090052" />Besides
which, these chirurgeons do these things in such a cruel way, that I could never endure to
see thee or know thee under the hands of any of them: wherefore my mind is quite made up
to do it myself, that, at least, if thou shalt suffer too much, I may give it over at
once, as a chirurgeon would not do.</q> <milestone id="p07090053" />And so she caused the instruments that
are used on such occasions to be brought her, and having dismissed all other attendants
save Lusca from the chamber, and locked the door, made Nicostratus lie down on a table,
set the pincers in his mouth, and clapped them on one of his teeth, which, while Lusca
held him, so that, albeit he roared for pain, he might not move, she wrenched by main
force from his jaw, <milestone id="p07090054" />and keeping it close, took from Lusca's hand another and
horribly decayed tooth, which she shewed him, suffering and half dead as he was, saying:
<q direct="unspecified">See what thou hadst in thy jaw; mark how far gone it is.</q> <milestone id="p07090055" />Believing what
she said, and deeming that, now the tooth was out, his breath would no more be offensive,
and being somewhat eased of the pain, which had been extreme, and still remained, so that
he murmured not little, by divers comforting applications, he quitted the chamber:
<milestone id="p07090056" />whereupon the lady forthwith sent the tooth to her lover, who, having now full
assurance of her love, placed himself entirely at her service. <milestone id="p07090057" />But the lady
being
minded to make his assurance yet more sure, and deeming each hour a thousand till she
might be with him, now saw fit, for the more ready performance of the promise she had
given him, to feign sickness; and Nicostratus, coming to see her one day after breakfast,
attended only by Pyrrhus, she besought him for her better solacement, to help her down to
the garden. <milestone id="p07090058" />Wherefore Nicostratus on one side, and Pyrrhus on the other, took
her and bore her down to the garden, and set her on a lawn at the foot of a beautiful
pear-tree: and after they had sate there a while, the lady, who had already <pb n="166" />given Pyrrhus to understand what he must do, said to him: <q direct="unspecified">Pyrrhus, I should
greatly like to have some of those pears; get thee up the tree, and shake some of them
down.</q> <milestone id="p07090059" />Pyrrhus climbed the tree in a trice, and began to shake down the
pears, and while he did so: <q direct="unspecified">Fie! Sir,</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">what is this you do? And you,
Madam, have you no shame, that you suffer him to do so in my presence?  Think you that I
am blind? 'Twas but now that you were gravely indisposed.  Your cure has been speedy
indeed to permit of your so behaving: and as for such a purpose you have so many goodly
chambers, why betake you not yourselves to one of them, if you must needs so disport
yourselves?  'Twould be much more decent than to do so in my presence.</q>
<milestone id="p07090060" />Whereupon the lady, turning to her husband: <q direct="unspecified">Now what can Pyrrhus mean?</q>
said she. <q direct="unspecified">Is he mad?</q> <milestone id="p07090061" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay, Madam,</q> quoth Pyrrhus; <q direct="unspecified">mad am not I.
Think you I see you not?</q> <milestone id="p07090062" />Whereat Nicostratus marvelled not a little; and:
<q direct="unspecified">Pyrrhus,</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">I verily believe thou dreamest.</q> <milestone id="p07090063" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay, my
lord,</q> replied Pyrrhus, <q direct="unspecified">not a whit do I dream; neither do you; rather you wag it
with such vigour, that, if this pear-tree did the like, there would be never a pear left
on it.</q> <milestone id="p07090064" />Then the lady: <q direct="unspecified">What can this mean?</q> quoth she: <q direct="unspecified">can it be
that it really seems to him to be as he says? Upon my hope of salvation, were I but in my
former health, I would get me up there to judge for myself what these wonders are which he
professes to see.</q> <milestone id="p07090065" />Whereupon, as Pyrrhus in the pear-tree continued talking
in the same strange strain: <q direct="unspecified">Come down,</q> quoth Nicostratus;
and when he was down: <q direct="unspecified">Now what,</q> said Nicostratus, <q direct="unspecified">is it thou sayst thou seest up
there?</q> <milestone id="p07090066" /><q direct="unspecified">I suppose,</q> replied Pyrrhus, <q direct="unspecified">that you take me to be deluded
or dreaming: but as I must needs tell you the truth, I saw you lying upon your wife, and
then, when I came down, I saw you get up and sit you down here where you now are.</q>
<milestone id="p07090067" /><q direct="unspecified">Therein,</q> said Nicostratus, <q direct="unspecified">thou wast certainly deluded, for, since
thou clombest the pear-tree, we have not budged a jot, save as thou seest.</q>
<milestone id="p07090068" />Then said Pyrrhus: <q direct="unspecified">Why make more words about the matter? See you I certainly
did; and, seeing you, I saw you lying upon your own.</q> <milestone id="p07090069" />Nicostratus' wonder
now waxed momently, insomuch that he said: <q direct="unspecified">I am minded to see if this
pear-tree be enchanted, so that whoso is in it sees marvels;</q> and so he got him up into
it. Whereupon the lady and Pyrrhus fell <pb n="167" />to disporting them, and Nicostratus,
seeing what they were about, exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">Ah! lewd woman, what is this thou doest? And
thou, Pyrrhus, in whom I so much trusted!</q> And so saying, he began to climb
down. <milestone id="p07090070" />Meanwhile the lady and Pyrrhus had made answer: <q direct="unspecified">We are sitting
here:</q> and seeing him descending, they placed themselves as they had been when he had
left them, whom Nicostratus, being come down, no sooner saw, than he fell a
rating them. <milestone id="p07090071" />Then quoth Pyrrhus: <q direct="unspecified">Verily, Nicostratus, I now acknowledge,
that, as you said a while ago, what I saw when I was in the pear-tree was but a false
show, albeit I had never understood that so it was but that I now see and know that thou
hast also seen a false show. <milestone id="p07090072" />And that I speak truth, you may sufficiently
assure yourself, if you but reflect whether 'tis likely that your wife, who for virtue and
discretion has not her peer among women, would, if she were minded so to dishonour you,
see fit to do so before your very eyes. Of myself I say nought, albeit I had liefer be
hewn in pieces than that I should so much as think of such a thing, much less do it in
your presence. <milestone id="p07090073" />Wherefore 'tis evident
that 'tis some illusion of sight that is propagated from the pear-tree;
for nought in the world would have made me believe that I saw not you lying there in
carnal intercourse with your wife, had I not heard you say that you saw me doing that
which most assuredly, so far from doing, I never so much as thought of.</q> <milestone id="p07090074" />The
lady then started up with a most resentful mien, and burst out with: <q direct="unspecified">Foul fall thee, if
thou knowest so little of me as to suppose that, if I were minded to do thee such foul
dishonour as thou sayst thou didst see me do, I would come hither to do it before thine
eyes! <milestone id="p07090075" />Rest assured that for such a purpose, were it ever mine, I should deem
one of our chambers more meet, and it should go hard but I would so order the matter that
thou shouldst never know aught of it.</q> <milestone id="p07090076" />Nicostratus, having heard both, and
deeming that what they both

averred must be true, to wit, that they would never have ventured upon such an act in his
presence, passed from chiding to talk of the

singularity of the thing, and how marvellous it was that the vision should reshape itself
for every one that clomb the tree. <milestone id="p07090077" />The lady, however, made a show of being
distressed that Nicostratus should so have thought of her, and: <q direct="unspecified">Verily,</q> quoth she,
<q direct="unspecified">no woman, neither I nor another, shall again suffer loss of honour by this <pb n="168" />pear-tree: <milestone id="p07090078" />run, Pyrrhus, and bring hither an axe, and at one and the
same time vindicate thy honour and mine by felling it, albeit 'twere better far
Nicostratus' skull should feel the weight of the axe, seeing that in utter heedlessness he
so readily suffered the eyes of his mind to be blinded; for, albeit this vision was seen
by the bodily eye, yet ought the understanding by no means to have entertained and
affirmed it as real.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07090079" />So Pyrrhus presently hied him to fetch the axe, and
returning therewith felled the pear; whereupon the lady, turning towards Nicostratus:
<q direct="unspecified">Now that this foe of my honour is fallen,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">my wrath is gone from
me.</q> Nicostratus then craving her pardon, she graciously granted it him, bidding him
never again to suffer himself to be betrayed into thinking such a thing of her, who loved
him more dearly than herself. <milestone id="p07090080" />So the poor duped husband went back with her and
her lover to the palace, where not seldom in time to come Pyrrhus and Lydia took their
pastime together more at ease. God grant us the like.</p></div2><pb n="169" /><div2 type="novella" who="dioneo" id="nov0710"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone id="p07100001" />Two Sienese love a lady, one of them being
her gossip: the gossip dies, having promised his comrade to return to him from the other
world; which he does, and tells him what sort of life is led
there.</p></argument><div3 who="author" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p07100002" />None now was left to tell, save
	the king, who, as soon as the ladies had ceased mourning over the fall of the pear-tree,
	that had done no wrong, and were silent, began thus:</p></div3><div3 who="dioneo" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p07100003" />Most manifest it is that
      'tis the prime duty of a just king to observe the laws that he has made; and, if he do not
      so, he is to be esteemed no king, but a slave that has merited punishment, into which
      fault, and under which condemnation, I, your king, must, as of necessity,
      fall. <milestone id="p07100004" />For, indeed, when yesterday I made the law which governs our discourse of
      to-day, I thought not to-day to avail myself of my privilege, but to submit to the law, no
      less than you, and to discourse of the same topic whereof you all have discoursed;
      <milestone id="p07100005" />but not only has the very story
      been told which I had intended to tell, but therewithal so many things else, and so very
      much goodlier have been said, that, search my memory as I may, I cannot mind me of aught,
      nor wot I that touching such a matter there is indeed aught, for me to say, that would be
      comparable with what has been said; <milestone id="p07100006" />wherefore, as infringe I must the law that
      I myself have made, I confess myself worthy of punishment, and instantly declaring my
      readiness to pay any forfeit that may be demanded of me, am minded to have recourse to my
      wonted privilege. <milestone id="p07100007" />And such, dearest ladies, is the potency of Elisa's story of
      the godfather and his gossip, and therewith of the simplicity of the Sienese, that I am
      prompted thereby to pass from this topic of the beguilement of foolish husbands by their
      cunning wives to a
      <pb n="170" />little story touching these same Sienese, which, albeit there is not a little
      therein which you were best not to believe, may yet be in
      some degree entertaining to hear.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p07100008" />Know, then, that at Siena there dwelt in Porta
Salaia two young men of the people, named, the one, Tingoccio Mini, the other Meuccio di
Tura, who, by what appeared, loved one another not a little, for they were scarce ever out
of one another's company; <milestone id="p07100009" />and being wont, like other folk, to go to church and
listen to sermons, they heard from time to time of the glory and the woe, which in the
other world are allotted, according to merit, to the souls of the dead.  Of which matters
craving, but being unable to come by, more certain assurance, they agreed together that,
whichever of them should die first, should, if he might, return to the survivor, and
certify him of that which he would fain know; and this agreement they confirmed with an
oath. <milestone id="p07100010" />Now, after they had made this engagement, and while they were still
constantly together, Tingoccio chanced to become sponsor to one Ambruogio Anselmini, that
dwelt in Campo Reggi, who had had a son by his wife, Monna Mita. <milestone id="p07100011" />The lady was
exceeding fair, and amorous withal, and Tingoccio being wont sometimes to visit her as his
gossip, and to take Meuccio with him, he,
notwithstanding his sponsorship, grew enamoured of her, as did also
Meuccio, for she pleased him not a little, and he heard her much commended by
Tingoccio. <milestone id="p07100012" />Which love each concealed from the other; but not for the same
reason. Tingoccio was averse to discover it to Meuccio, for that he deemed it an
ignominious thing to love his gossip, and was ashamed to let any one know it. Meuccio was
on his guard for a very different reason, to wit, that he was already ware that the lady
was in Tingoccio's good graces. <milestone id="p07100013" />Wherefore he said to himself: If I avow my love
to him, he will be jealous of me, and as, being her gossip, he can speak with her as
often as he pleases, he will do all he can to make her hate me, and so I shall never have
any favour of her.</p><p><milestone id="p07100014" />Now, the two young men being thus, as I have said, on terms of
most familiar friendship, it befell that Tingoccio, being the better able to open his
heart to the lady, did so order his demeanour and discourse that he had from her all that
he desired. Nor was his friend's success hidden from Meuccio; though, much as it vexed
him, yet still cherishing the hope of eventually attaining his end, and <pb n="171" />
fearing to give Tingoccio occasion to baulk or hamper him in some way, he feigned
to know nought of the matter. <milestone id="p07100015" />So Tingoccio, more fortunate than his comrade,
and rival in love, did with such assiduity till his gossip's good land that he got thereby
a malady, which in the course of some days waxed so grievous that he succumbed thereto,
and departed this life. <milestone id="p07100016" />And on the night of the third day after his
decease (perchance because earlier he might not) he made his appearance,
according to his promise, in Meuccio's chamber, and called Meuccio, who was fast asleep,
by his name. <milestone id="p07100017" />Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Who art thou?</q> quoth Meuccio, as he
awoke. <milestone id="p07100018" /><q direct="unspecified">'Tis I, Tingoccio,</q> replied he, <q direct="unspecified">come back, in fulfilment of the
pledge I gave thee, to give thee tidings of the other world.</q> <milestone id="p07100019" />For a while
Meuccio saw him not without terror: then, his courage reviving: <q direct="unspecified">Welcome, my
brother,</q> quoth he: and proceeded to ask him if he were lost.  <milestone id="p07100020" /><q direct="unspecified">Nought is
lost but what is irrecoverable,</q> replied Tingoccio: <q direct="unspecified">how then should I be here, if I
were lost?</q> <milestone id="p07100021" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay,</q> quoth then Meuccio; <q direct="unspecified">I mean it not so: I would
know of thee, whether thou art of the number of the souls that are condemned to the penal
fire of hell.</q> <milestone id="p07100022" /><q direct="unspecified">Why no,</q> returned Tingoccio, <q direct="unspecified">not just that; but
still for the sins that I did I am in most sore and grievous torment.</q>
<milestone id="p07100023" />Meuccio then questioned Tingoccio in detail of the pains there meted out for
each of the sins done here; and Tingoccio enumerated them all.  Whereupon Meuccio asked if
there were aught he might do for him
here on earth. Tingoccio answered in the affirmative; to wit, that he might have masses
and prayers said and alms-deeds done for him, for that such things were of great service
to the souls there. <q direct="unspecified">That gladly will I,</q> replied Meuccio; <milestone id="p07100024" />and then, as
Tingoccio was about to take his leave, he bethought him of the gossip, and raising his
head a little, he said: <q direct="unspecified">I mind me, Tingoccio, of the gossip, with whom thou wast wont
to lie when thou wast here. Now what is thy punishment for that?</q> <milestone id="p07100025" /><q direct="unspecified">My
brother,</q> returned Tingoccio, <q direct="unspecified">as soon as I got down there, I met one that seemed to
know all my sins by heart, who bade me betake me to a place, where, while in direst
torment I bewept my sins, I found comrades not a few condemned to the same pains; and so,
standing there among them, and calling to mind what I had done with the gossip, and
foreboding in
requital thereof a much greater torment than had yet been allotted me, albeit I was in a
great and most vehement flame, I quaked for <pb n="172" />fear in every part of
me. <milestone id="p07100026" />Which one that was beside me observing:
'What,' quoth he, 'hast thou done more than the rest of us that are here, that thou
quakest thus as thou standest in the fire?' 'My friend,' quoth I, 'I am in mortal fear of
the doom that I expect for a great sin that I once committed.' <milestone id="p07100027" />He then asked
what sin it might be. ''Twas on this wise,' replied I: 'I lay with my gossip, and that so
much that I died thereof.'  <milestone id="p07100028" />Whereat, he did but laugh, saying: 'Go to, fool,
make thy mind easy; for here there is no account taken of gossips.' Which completely
revived my drooping spirits.</q></p><p><milestone id="p07100029" />'Twas now near daybreak: wherefore: <q direct="unspecified">Adieu! Meuccio,</q> quoth his friend: <q direct="unspecified">for
longer tarry with thee I may not;</q> and so he vanished. <milestone id="p07100030" />As for Meuccio,
having learned that no account was taken of gossips in the other world, he began to laugh
at his own folly in that he had already spared divers such; and so, being quit of his
ignorance, he in that respect in course of time waxed wise.  Which matters had Fra Rinaldo
but known, he would not have
needed to go about syllogizing in order to bring his fair gossip to
pleasure him.</p></div2><div2 type="conclusion" who="author" id="d07conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone id="p07970001" />The sun was westering, and a light breeze blew,
when the king, his story ended, and none else being left to speak, arose, and taking off
the crown, set it on Lauretta's head, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, I crown you with yourself<note>A
play upon laurea (laurel wreath) and Lauretta.</note> queen of our
company: 'tis now for you, as our sovereign lady, to make such ordinances as you shall
deem meet for our common solace and delectation;</q> and having so said, he sat him
down again. <milestone id="p07970002" />Queen Lauretta sent for the seneschal, and bade him have a care
that the tables should be set in the pleasant vale somewhat earlier than had been their
wont, that their return to the palace might be more leisurely; after which she gave him to
know what else he had to do during her sovereignty. <milestone id="p07970003" />Then turning to the
company: <q direct="unspecified">Yesterday,</q> quoth she, <q direct="unspecified">Dioneo would have it that to-day we should
discourse of the tricks that wives play their husbands; and but that I am minded not to
shew as of the breed of yelping curs, that are ever prompt to retaliate, I would ordain
that to-morrow we discourse of the tricks that husbands play their wives.
<milestone id="p07970004" />However, in lieu thereof, I will have every one take thought to tell of those
tricks <pb n="173" />that, daily, woman plays man, or man woman, or one man another;
wherein, I doubt not, there will be matter of discourse no less agreeable than has been
that of to-day.</q> So saying, she rose and dismissed the company until
supper-time. <milestone id="p07970005" />So the ladies and the men being risen, some bared their feet and
betook them to the clear water, there to disport them, while others took their pleasure
upon the green lawn amid the trees that there grew goodly and straight. <milestone id="p07970006" />For no
brief
while Dioneo and Fiammetta sang in concert of Arcite and Palamon.  And so, each and all
taking their several pastimes, they sped the hours with exceeding great delight until
supper-time. Which being come, they sat them down at table beside the little lake, and
there, while a thousand songsters charmed their ears, and a gentle breeze, that blew from
the environing hills, fanned them, and never a fly annoyed them, reposefully and joyously
they supped. <milestone id="p07970007" />The tables removed, they roved a while about the pleasant vale,
and then, the sun being still high, for 'twas but half vespers, the queen gave the word,
and they wended their way back to their wonted abode, and going slowly, and beguiling the
way with quips and quirks without number upon divers matters, nor those alone of which
they had that day discoursed, they arrived, hard upon nightfall, at the goodly palace.
<milestone id="p07970008" />There, the short walk's fatigue dispelled by wines most cool and
comfits, they presently gathered for the dance about the fair fountain,
and now they footed it to the strains of Tindaro's cornemuse, and now to other
music. <milestone id="p07970009" />Which done, the queen bade Filomena give them a song; and thus Filomena
sang:</p><div3 who="filomena" type="song"><lg><milestone id="p07970010" /><l>Ah! woe

<l>Throbs ever the same fire</l>
<l>Of yearning there
where erst I was to be.</l>
<l>O thou in whom is all my weal, my

<l>Lord of my heart's desire,</l>
<l>Ah! tell me thou! for none
to ask save thee</l>
<l>Neither dare I, nor see.</l>

<l>Thou wilt not, but with hope at length
console.</l></lg><pb n="174" /><lg><milestone id="p07970012" /><l>Kindled the flame I know not what

<l>Which me doth so devour,</l>
<l>That day and night alike I

<l>For whether it was by hearing, touch, or

<l>Unwonted was the power,</l>
<l>And fresh the fire that me
each way did seize;</l>
<l>Wherein without release</l>
<l>I languish still,
and of thee, Lord, am fain,</l>
<l>For thou alone canst comfort and make
whole.</l></lg><lg><milestone id="p07970013" /><l>Ah! tell me if it shall be, and how

<l>Deny not; say that fleet</l>
<l>Thou hiest hither: comfort thus
my grief.</l>
<l>Ah! let the time be brief</l>
<l>Till thou art here, and
then long time remain;</l>
<l>For I, Love-stricken, crave but Love's
control.</l></lg><lg><milestone id="p07970014" /><l>Let me but once again mine own thee
call,</l>
<l>No more so indiscreet</l>
<l>As erst, I'll be, to let thee

<l>Nay, I'll still hold thee, let what may

<l>And of thy mouth so sweet</l>
<l>Such solace take as may
content my heart:</l>
<l>So this be all my art,</l>
<l>Thee to entice, me
with thine arms to enchain:</l>
<l>Whereon but musing inly chants my
soul.</l></lg></div3><p><milestone id="p07970015" />This song set all the company conjecturing what new and delightsome love might now hold
Filomena in its sway; and as its words imported that she had had more joyance thereof than
sight alone

might yield, some that were there grew envious of her excess of happiness.  However, the
song being ended, the queen, bethinking her that the morrow was Friday, thus graciously
addressed them all: <milestone id="p07970016" /><q direct="unspecified">Ye wot, noble ladies, and ye also, my gallants, that
to-morrow is the day that is sacred to the passion of our Lord, which, if ye remember, we
kept devoutly when Neifile was queen, intermitting delectable discourse, as we did also on
the ensuing Saturday.  <milestone id="p07970017" />Where<pb n="175" />fore, being minded to follow Neifile's
excellent example, I deem that now, as then, 'twere a seemly thing to surcease from this
our pastime of story-telling for those two days, and compose our minds to meditation on
what was at that season accomplished for the weal of our souls.</q> <milestone id="p07970018" />All the
company having approved their queen's devout speech, she, as the night was now far spent,
dismissed them; and so they all betook them to slumber.</p></div2></div1>
