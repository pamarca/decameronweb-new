 his vassals, consents to take a wife, but, being minded
 to please himself in the choice of her, takes a husbandman's
 daughter. He has two children by her, both
 of whom he makes her believe that he has put to death.

 well pleased, quoth Dioneo with a laugh: <q direct="unspecified">The good man that
 looked that night to cause the bogey's tail to droop, would scarce have
 contributed two pennyworth of all the praise you bestow on Messer
 Torello:</q> then, witting that it now only remained for him to tell,
 thus he began:</p></div3><div3 who="dioneo" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p00100003" />Gentle my ladies, this day, meseems, is dedicate to
 Kings and Soldans and folk of the like quality; wherefore, that I
 stray not too far from you, I am minded to tell you somewhat of a
 Marquis; certes, nought magnificent, but a piece of mad folly, albeit
 there came good thereof to him in the end. The which I counsel
 none to copy, for that great pity 'twas that it turned out well with
 him.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p00100004" />There was in olden days a certain Marquis of Saluzzo, Gualtieri
 <pb n="388" />by name, a young man, but head of the house, who, having
 neither wife nor child, passed his time in nought else but in hawking
 and hunting, and of taking a wife and begetting children had
 no thought; wherein he should have been accounted very wise:
  <milestone id="p00100005" />but his vassals, brooking it ill, did oftentimes entreat him to take
 a wife, that he might not die without an heir, and they be left
 without a lord; offering to find him one of such a pattern, and
 of such parentage, that he might marry with good hope, and be
 well content with the sequel.  <milestone id="p00100006" />To whom: <q direct="unspecified">My friends,</q> replied
 Gualtieri, <q direct="unspecified">you enforce me to that which I had resolved never to do,
 seeing how hard it is to find a wife, whose ways accord well with
 one's own, and how plentiful is the supply of such as run counter
 thereto, and how grievous a life he leads who chances upon a lady
 that matches ill with him.  <milestone id="p00100007" />And to say that you think to know the
 daughters by the qualities of their fathers and mothers, and thereby--so
 you would argue--to provide me with a wife to my liking, is but
 folly; for I wot not how you may penetrate the secrets of their
 mothers so as to know their fathers; and granted that you do know
 them, daughters oftentimes resemble neither of their parents.  <milestone id="p00100008" />However,
 as you are minded to rivet these fetters upon me, I am content
 that so it be; and that I may have no cause to reproach any but
 myself, should it turn out ill, I am resolved that my wife shall be of
 my own choosing; but of this rest assured, that, no matter whom
 I choose, if she receive not from you the honour due to a lady, you
 shall prove to your great cost, how sorely I resent being thus constrained
 by your importunity to take a wife against my will.</q></p><p>The worthy men replied that they were well content, so only he
 would marry without more ado.  <milestone id="p00100009" />And Gualtieri, who had long noted
 with approval the mien of a poor girl that dwelt on a farm hard by
 his house, and found her fair enough, deemed that with her he might
 pass a tolerably happy life. Wherefore he sought no further, but
 forthwith resolved to marry her; and having sent for her father, who
 was a very poor man, he contracted with him to take her to wife.
  <milestone id="p00100010" />Which done, Gualtieri assembled all the friends he had in those parts,
 and: <q direct="unspecified">My friends,</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">you were and are minded that I
 should take a wife, and rather to comply with your wishes, than for
 any desire that I had to marry, I have made up my mind to do so.
  <milestone id="p00100011" />You remember the promise you gave me, to wit, that, whomsoever I
 <pb n="389" />should take, you would pay her the honour due to a lady. Which
 promise I now require you to keep, the time being come when I am
 to keep mine.  <milestone id="p00100012" />I have found hard by here a maiden after mine own
 heart, whom I purpose to take to wife, and to bring hither to my
 house in the course of a few days. Wherefore bethink you, how
 you may make the nuptial feast splendid, and welcome her with all
 honour; that I may confess myself satisfied with your observance of
 your promise, as you will be with my observance of mine.</q>  <milestone id="p00100013" />The
 worthy men, one and all, answered with alacrity that they were well
 content, and that, whoever she might be, they would entreat her as
 a lady, and pay her all due honour as such. After which, they all
 addressed them to make goodly and grand and gladsome celebration
 of the event, as did also Gualtieri.  <milestone id="p00100014" />He arranged for a wedding most
 stately and fair, and bade thereto a goodly number of his friends and
 kinsfolk, and great gentlemen, and others, of the neighbourhood;
 and therewithal he caused many a fine and costly robe to be cut and
 fashioned to the figure of a girl who seemed to him of the like proportions
 as the girl that he purposed to wed; and laid in store,
 besides, of girdles and rings, with a costly and beautiful crown, and
 all the other paraphernalia of a bride.</p><p><milestone id="p00100015" />The day that he had appointed for the wedding being come,
 about half tierce he got him to horse with as many as had come to
 do him honour, and having made all needful dispositions: <q direct="unspecified">Gentlemen,</q>
 quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">'tis time to go bring home the bride.</q> And so
 away he rode with his company to the village;  <milestone id="p00100016" />where, being come
 to the house of the girl's father, they found her returning from the
 spring with a bucket of water, making all the haste she could, that
 she might afterwards go with the other women to see Gualtieri's
 bride come by. Whom Gualtieri no sooner saw, than he called her
 by her name, to wit, Griselda, and asked her where her father was.
 To whom she modestly made answer: <q direct="unspecified">My lord, he is in the house.</q>
  <milestone id="p00100017" />Whereupon Gualtieri dismounted, and having bidden the rest await
 him without, entered the cottage alone; and meeting her father,
 whose name was Giannucolo: <q direct="unspecified">I am come,</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">to wed
 Griselda, but first of all there are some matters I would learn from
 her own lips in thy presence.</q>  <milestone id="p00100018" />He then asked her, whether, if he
 took her to wife, she would study to comply with his wishes, and be
 not wroth, no matter what he might say or do, and be obedient,
 <pb n="390" />with not a few other questions of a like sort: to all which she
 answered, ay.  <milestone id="p00100019" />Whereupon Gualtieri took her by the hand, led her
 forth, and before the eyes of all his company, and as many other
 folk as were there, caused her to strip naked, and let bring the
 garments that he had had fashioned for her, and had her forthwith
 arrayed therein, and upon her unkempt head let set a crown;  <milestone id="p00100020" />and
 then, while all wondered: <q direct="unspecified">Gentlemen,</q> quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">this is she
 whom I purpose to make my wife, so she be minded to have me for
 husband.</q> Then, she standing abashed and astonied, he turned to
 her, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Griselda, wilt thou have me for thy husband?</q>  <milestone id="p00100021" />To
 whom: <q direct="unspecified">Ay, my lord,</q> answered she.  <milestone id="p00100022" /><q direct="unspecified">And I will have thee to
 wife,</q> said he, and married her before them all. And having set her
 upon a palfrey, he brought her home with pomp.</p><p><milestone id="p00100023" />The wedding was fair and stately, and had he married a daughter
 of the King of France, the feast could not have been more splendid.
  <milestone id="p00100024" />It seemed as if, with the change of her garb, the bride had acquired
 a new dignity of mind and mien. She was, as we have said, fair of
 form and feature; and therewithal she was now grown so engaging
 and gracious and debonair, that she shewed no longer as the shepherdess,
 and the daughter of Giannucolo, but as the daughter of some noble
 lord, insomuch that she caused as many as had known her before to
 marvel. Moreover, she was so obedient and devoted to her husband,
 that he deemed himself the happiest and luckiest man in the world.
  <milestone id="p00100025" />And likewise so gracious and kindly was she to her husband's vassals,
 that there was none of them but loved her more dearly than himself,
 and was zealous to do her honour, and prayed for her welfare and
 prosperity and aggrandisement, and instead of, as erstwhile, saying
 that Gualtieri had done foolishly to take her to wife, now averred
 that he had not his like in the world for wisdom and discernment,
 for that, save to him, her noble qualities would ever have remained
 hidden under her sorry apparel and the garb of the peasant girl.
  <milestone id="p00100026" />And in short she so comported herself as in no long time to bring it
 to pass that, not only in the marquisate, but far and wide besides, her
 virtues and her admirable conversation were matter of common talk,
 and, if aught had been said to the disadvantage of her husband, when
 he married her, the judgment was now altogether to the contrary
 effect.</p><p><milestone id="p00100027" />She had not been long with Gualtieri before she conceived; and
 <pb n="391" />in due time she was delivered of a girl; whereat Gualtieri made great
 cheer. But, soon after, a strange humour took possession of him,
 to wit, to put her patience to the proof by prolonged and intolerable
 hard usage; wherefore he began by afflicting her with his gibes,
 putting on a vexed air, and telling her that his vassals were most
 sorely dissatisfied with her by reason of her base condition, and all
 the more so since they saw that she was a mother, and that they
 did nought but most ruefully murmur at the birth of a daughter.
  <milestone id="p00100028" />Whereto Griselda, without the least change of countenance or sign
 of discomposure, made answer: <q direct="unspecified">My lord, do with me as thou
 mayst deem best for thine own honour and comfort, for well I wot
 that I am of less account than they, and unworthy of this honourable
 estate to which of thy courtesy thou hast advanced me.</q>  <milestone id="p00100029" />By which
 answer Gualtieri was well pleased, witting that she was in no degree
 puffed up with pride by his, or any other's, honourable entreatment
 of her.  <milestone id="p00100030" />A while afterwards, having in general terms given his wife
 to understand that the vassals could not endure her daughter, he sent
 her a message by a servant. So the servant came, and: <q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q>
 quoth he with a most dolorous mien, <q direct="unspecified">so I value my life, I must
 needs do my lord's bidding. He has bidden me take your daughter
 and . . .</q>  <milestone id="p00100031" />He said no more, but the lady by what she heard, and
 read in his face, and remembered of her husband's words, understood
 that he was bidden to put the child to death. Whereupon she
 presently took the child from the cradle, and having kissed and blessed
 her, albeit she was very sore at heart, she changed not countenance,
 but placed it in the servant's arms, saying:  <milestone id="p00100032" /><q direct="unspecified">See that thou leave
 nought undone that my lord and thine has charged thee to do, but
 leave her not so that the beasts and the birds devour her, unless he
 have so bidden thee.</q>  <milestone id="p00100033" />So the servant took the child, and told
 Gualtieri what the lady had said; and Gualtieri, marvelling at her
 constancy, sent him with the child to Bologna, to one of his kinswomen,
 whom he besought to rear and educate the child with all
 care, but never to let it be known whose child she was.</p><p><milestone id="p00100034" />Soon after it befell that the lady again conceived, and in due
 time was delivered of a son, whereat Gualtieri was overjoyed. But,
 not content with what he had done, he now even more poignantly
 afflicted the lady; and one day with a ruffled mien:  <milestone id="p00100035" /><q direct="unspecified">Wife,</q>
 quoth he, <q direct="unspecified">since thou gavest birth to this boy, I may on no wise live
 <pb n="392" />in peace with my vassals, so bitterly do they reproach me that a
 grandson of Giannucolo is to succeed me as their lord; and therefore I
 fear that, so I be not minded to be sent a packing hence, I must even
 do herein as I did before, and in the end put thee away, and take
 another wife.</q>  <milestone id="p00100036" />The lady heard him patiently, and answered only:
 <q direct="unspecified">My lord, study how thou mayst content thee and best please thyself,
 and waste no thought upon me, for there is nought I desire save in so
 far as I know that 'tis thy pleasure.</q>  <milestone id="p00100037" />Not many days after, Gualtieri,
 in like manner as he had sent for the daughter, sent for the son, and
 having made a shew of putting him to death, provided for his, as for
 the girl's, nurture at Bologna.  <milestone id="p00100038" />Whereat the lady shewed no more
 discomposure of countenance or speech than at the loss of her
 daughter: which Gualtieri found passing strange, and inly affirmed
 that there was never another woman in the world that would have
 so done. And but that he had marked that she was most tenderly
 affectionate towards her children, while 'twas well pleasing to him, he
 had supposed that she was tired of them, whereas he knew that 'twas
 of her discretion that she so did.  <milestone id="p00100039" />His vassals, who believed that he had
 put the children to death, held him mightily to blame for his cruelty,
 and felt the utmost compassion for the lady. She, however, said
 never aught to the ladies that condoled with her on the death of her
 children, but that the pleasure of him that had begotten them was
 her pleasure likewise.</p><p><milestone id="p00100040" />Years not a few had passed since the girl's birth, when Gualtieri
 at length deemed the time come to put his wife's patience to the
 final proof. Accordingly, in the presence of a great company of his
 vassals he declared that on no wise might he longer brook to have
 Griselda to wife, that he confessed that in taking her he had done a
 sorry thing and the act of a stripling, and that he therefore meant to
 do what he could to procure the Pope's dispensation to put Griselda
 away, and take another wife: for which cause being much upbraided
 by many worthy men, he made no other answer but only that needs
 must it so be.  <milestone id="p00100041" />Whereof the lady being apprised, and now deeming
 that she must look to go back to her father's house, and perchance
 tend the sheep, as she had aforetime, and see him, to whom she
 was utterly devoted, engrossed by another woman, did inly bewail
 herself right sorely: but still with the same composed mien with
 which she had borne Fortune's former buffets, she set herself to endure
 <pb n="393" />this last outrage.  <milestone id="p00100042" />Nor was it long before Gualtieri by counterfeit
 letters, which he caused to be sent to him from Rome, made his
 vassals believe that the Pope had thereby given him a dispensation to
 put Griselda away, and take another wife. Wherefore, having caused
 her to be brought before him, he said to her in the presence of not a
 few:  <milestone id="p00100043" /><q direct="unspecified">Wife, by license granted me by the Pope, I am now free
 to put thee away, and take another wife; and, for that my forbears
 have always been great gentlemen and lords of these parts, whereas
 thine have ever been husbandmen, I purpose that thou go back
 to Giannucolo's house with the dowry that thou broughtest me;
 whereupon I shall bring home a lady that I have found, and who is
 meet to be my wife.</q></p><p><milestone id="p00100044" />'Twas not without travail most grievous that the lady, as she
 heard this announcement, got the better of her woman's nature, and
 suppressing her tears, made answer: <q direct="unspecified">My lord, I ever knew that
 my low degree was on no wise congruous with your nobility, and
 acknowledged that the rank I had with you was of your and God's
 bestowal, nor did I ever make as if it were mine by gift, or so esteem
 it, but still accounted it as a loan. 'Tis your pleasure to recall it,
 and therefore it should be, and is, my pleasure to render it up to you.
 So, here is your ring, with which you espoused me; take it back.
  <milestone id="p00100045" />You bid me take with me the dowry that I brought you; which to
 do will require neither paymaster on your part nor purse nor packhorse
 on mine; for I am not unmindful that naked was I when you
 first had me. And if you deem it seemly that that body in which I
 have borne children, by you begotten, be beheld of all, naked will I
 depart; but yet, I pray you, be pleased, in guerdon of the virginity
 that I brought you and take not away, to suffer me to bear hence
 upon my back a single shift--I crave no more--besides my dowry.</q>
  <milestone id="p00100046" />There was nought of which Gualtieri was so fain as to weep; but
 yet, setting his face as a flint, he made answer: <q direct="unspecified">I allow thee a
 shift to thy back; so get thee hence.</q>  <milestone id="p00100047" />All that stood by besought
 him to give her a robe, that she, who had been his wife for thirteen
 years and more, might not be seen to quit his house in so sorry and
 shameful a plight, having nought on her but a shift. But their
 entreaties went for nothing: the lady in her shift, and barefoot and
 bareheaded, having bade them adieu, departed the house, and went
 back to her father amid the tears and lamentations of all that saw
 <pb n="394" />her.  <milestone id="p00100048" />Giannucolo, who had ever deemed it a thing incredible
 that Gualtieri should keep his daughter to wife, and had looked
 for this to happen every day, and had kept the clothes that she
 had put off on the morning that Gualtieri had wedded her, now
 brought them to her; and she, having resumed them, applied herself
 to the petty drudgery of her father's house, as she had been wont,
 enduring with fortitude this cruel visitation of adverse Fortune.</p><p><milestone id="p00100049" />Now no sooner had Gualtieri dismissed Griselda, than he gave his
 vassals to understand that he had taken to wife a daughter of one of
 the Counts of Panago. He accordingly made great preparations as
 for the nuptials, during which he sent for Griselda. To whom,
 being come, quoth he:  <milestone id="p00100050" /><q direct="unspecified">I am bringing hither my new bride, and
 in this her first home-coming I purpose to shew her honour; and
 thou knowest that women I have none in the house that know
 how to set chambers in due order, or attend to the many other
 matters that so joyful an event requires; wherefore do thou, that
 understandest these things better than another, see to all that needs
 be done, and bid hither such ladies as thou mayst see fit, and
 receive them, as if thou wert the lady of the house, and then,
 when the nuptials are ended, thou mayst go back to thy cottage.</q>
  <milestone id="p00100051" />Albeit each of these words pierced Griselda's heart like a knife,
 for that, in resigning her good fortune, she had not been able to
 renounce the love she bore Gualtieri, nevertheless: <q direct="unspecified">My lord,</q> she
 made answer, <q direct="unspecified">I am ready and prompt to do your pleasure.</q>  <milestone id="p00100052" />And
 so, clad in her sorry garments of coarse romagnole, she entered the
 house, which, but a little before, she had quitted in her shift, and
 addressed her to sweep the chambers, and arrange arras and cushions
 in the halls, and make ready the kitchen, and set her hand to everything,
 as if she had been a paltry serving-wench: nor did she rest
 until she had brought all into such meet and seemly trim as the
 occasion demanded.  <milestone id="p00100053" />This done, she invited in Gualtieri's name all
 the ladies of those parts to be present at his nuptials, and awaited the
 event. The day being come, still wearing her sorry weeds, but in
 heart and soul and mien the lady, she received the ladies as they
 came, and gave each a gladsome greeting.</p><p><milestone id="p00100054" />Now Gualtieri, as we said, had caused his children to be carefully
 nurtured and brought up by a kinswoman of his at Bologna, which
 kinswoman was married into the family of the Counts of Panago;
 <pb n="395" />and, the girl being now twelve years old, and the loveliest creature
 that ever was seen, and the boy being about six years old, he had
 sent word to his kinswoman's husband at Bologna, praying him to
 be pleased to come with this girl and boy of his to Saluzzo, and to
 see that he brought a goodly and honourable company with him,
 and to give all to understand that he brought the girl to him to
 wife, and on no wis&#232; to disclose to any, who she really was.  <milestone id="p00100055" />The
 gentleman did as the Marquis bade him, and within a few days of
 his setting forth arrived at Saluzzo about breakfast-time with the
 girl, and her brother, and a noble company, and found all the folk of
 those parts, and much people besides, gathered there in expectation
 of Gualtieri's new bride.  <milestone id="p00100056" />Who, being received by the ladies, was
 no sooner come into the hall, where the tables were set, than Griselda
 advanced to meet her, saying with hearty cheer: <q direct="unspecified">Welcome, my
 lady.</q> So the ladies, who had with much instance, but in vain, besought
 Gualtieri, either to let Griselda keep in another room, or at any
 rate to furnish her with one of the robes that had been hers, that she
 might not present herself in such a sorry guise before the strangers,
 sate down to table; and the service being begun,  <milestone id="p00100057" />the eyes of all were
 set on the girl, and every one said that Gualtieri had made a good
 exchange, and Griselda joined with the rest in greatly commending
 her, and also her little brother.  <milestone id="p00100058" />And now Gualtieri, sated at last
 with all that he had seen of his wife's patience, marking that this
 new and strange turn made not the least alteration in her demeanour,
 and being well assured that 'twas not due to apathy, for he knew her
 to be of excellent understanding, deemed it time to relieve her
 of the suffering which he judged her to dissemble under a resolute
 front; and so, having called her to him in presence of them all, he
 said with a smile: <q direct="unspecified">And what thinkst thou of our bride?</q>
  <milestone id="p00100059" /><q direct="unspecified">My lord,</q> replied Griselda, <q direct="unspecified">I think mighty well of her; and if
 she be but as discreet as she is fair--and so I deem her--I make no
 doubt but you may reckon to lead with her a life of incomparable
 felicity; but with all earnestness I entreat you, that you spare her
 those tribulations which you did once inflict upon another that was
 yours, for I scarce think she would be able to bear them, as well
 because she is younger, as for that she has been delicately nurtured,
 whereas that other had known no respite of hardship since she was
 but a little child.</q>  <milestone id="p00100060" />Marking that she made no doubt but that the
 <pb n="396" />girl was to be his wife, and yet spoke never a whit the less sweetly,
 Gualtieri caused her to sit down beside him, and:  <milestone id="p00100061" /><q direct="unspecified">Griselda,</q>
 said he, <q direct="unspecified">'tis now time that thou see the reward of thy long patience,
 and that those, who have deemed me cruel and unjust and insensate,
 should know that what I did was done of purpose aforethought, for
 that I was minded to give both thee and them a lesson, that thou
 mightst learn to be a wife, and they in like manner might learn how
 to take and keep a wife, and that I might beget me perpetual peace
 with thee for the rest of my life; whereof being in great fear, when
 I came to take a wife, lest I should be disappointed, I therefore, to
 put the matter to the proof, did, and how sorely thou knowest, harass
 and afflict thee.  <milestone id="p00100062" />And since I never knew thee either by deed or by
 word to deviate from my will, I now, deeming myself to have of
 thee that assurance of happiness which I desired, am minded to
 restore to thee at once all that, step by step, I took from thee, and
 by extremity of joy to compensate the tribulations that I inflicted
 on thee.  <milestone id="p00100063" />Receive, then, this girl, whom thou supposest to be my
 bride, and her brother, with glad heart, as thy children and mine.
 These are they, whom by thee and many another it has long been
 supposed that I did ruthlessly to death, and I am thy husband, that
 loves thee more dearly than aught else, deeming that other there is
 none that has the like good cause to be well content with his wife.</q></p><p><milestone id="p00100064" />Which said, he embraced and kissed her; and then, while she
 wept for joy, they rose and hied them there where sate the daughter,
 all astonied to hear the news, whom, as also her brother, they tenderly
 embraced, and explained to them, and many others that stood
 by, the whole mystery.  <milestone id="p00100065" />Whereat the ladies, transported with delight,
 rose from table and betook them with Griselda to a chamber,
 and, with better omen, divested her of her sorry garb, and arrayed
 her in one of her own robes of state; and so, in guise of a lady
 (howbeit in her rags she had shewed as no less) they led her back
 into the hall.  <milestone id="p00100066" />Wondrous was the cheer which there they made
 with the children; and, all overjoyed at the event, they revelled and
 made merry amain, and prolonged the festivities for several days;
 and very discreet they pronounced Gualtieri, albeit they censured as
 intolerably harsh the probation to which he had subjected Griselda,
 and most discreet beyond all compare they accounted Griselda.</p><p><milestone id="p00100067" />Some days after, the Count of Panago returned to Bologna, and
 <pb n="397" />Gualtieri took Giannucolo from his husbandry, and established him
 in honour as his father-in-law, wherein to his great solace he lived
 for the rest of his days. Gualtieri himself, having mated his daughter
 with a husband of high degree, lived long and happily thereafter with
 Griselda, to whom he ever paid all honour.</p><p><milestone id="p00100068" />Now what shall we say in this case but that even into the cots of
 the poor the heavens let fall at times spirits divine, as into the palaces
 of kings souls that are fitter to tend hogs than to exercise lordship over
 men? Who but Griselda had been able, with a countenance not only
 tearless, but cheerful, to endure the hard and unheard-of trials to which
 Gualtieri subjected her?  <milestone id="p00100069" />Who perhaps might have deemed himself
 to have made no bad investment, had he chanced upon one, who,
 having been turned out of his house in her shift, had found means so
 to dust the pelisse of another as to get herself thereby a fine robe.</p></div2>
