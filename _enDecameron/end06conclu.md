  Immense was the delight and
diversion which this story afforded
 to all the company alike, and great
and general was the laughter over
 Fra Cipolla, and more especially at his
pilgrimage, and the relics, as
 well those that he had but seen as those
that he had brought back
 with him. Which being ended, the queen, taking
note that therewith
 the close of her sovereignty was come, stood up, took
off the
 crown, and set it on Dioneo's head, saying with a laugh:
  <a name="p06970002">
   [002]
  </a>
  <q direct="unspecified">
   'Tis
time, Dioneo, that thou prove the weight of the burden of having
 ladies to
govern and guide. Be thou king then; and let thy rule
 be such that, when
'tis ended, we may have cause to commend it.
  </q>
  <a name="p06970003">
   [003]
  </a>
  Dioneo took the crown,
and laughingly answered:
  <q direct="unspecified">
   Kings worthier
 far than I you may well have
seen many a time ere now--I speak
 of the kings in chess; but let me have
of you that obedience which
 is due to a true king, and of a surety I will
give you to taste of that
 solace, without which perfection of joy there
may not be in any
 festivity. But enough of this: I will govern as best I
may.
  </q>
  <a name="p06970004">
   [004]
  </a>
  Then,
 as was the wont, he sent for the seneschal, and gave him
particular
 instruction how to order matters during the term of his
sovereignty,
 which done, he said:
  <q direct="unspecified">
   Noble ladies, such and so diverse has
been
 our discourse of the ways of men and their various fortunes, that
but for the visit that we had a while ago from Madam Licisca, who
 by what
she said has furnished me with matter of discourse for
 to-morrow, I doubt
I had been not a little put to it to find a theme.
   <a name="p06970005">
    [005]
   </a>
   You heard how she said
that there was not a woman in her neighbourhood
 whose husband had her
virginity; adding that well she knew
   how many and what manner
of tricks they, after marriage, played
 their husbands.
   <a name="p06970006">
    [006]
   </a>
   The first count we
may well leave to the girls
 whom it concerns; the second, methinks, should
prove a diverting
 topic: wherefore I ordain that, taking our cue from
Madam Licisca,
 we discourse to-morrow of the tricks that, either for love
or for their
 deliverance from peril, ladies have heretofore played their
husbands,
 and whether they were by the said husbands detected or no.
  </q>
  <a name="p06970007">
   [007]
  </a>
  To
 discourse of such a topic some of the ladies deemed unmeet for them,
and besought the king to find another theme. But the king made
 answer:
  <a name="p06970008">
   [008]
  </a>
  <q direct="unspecified">
   Ladies, what manner of theme I have prescribed I know
 as well as you,
nor was I to be diverted from prescribing it by that
 which you now think
to declare unto me, for I wot the times are
 such that, so only men and
women have a care to do nought that is
 unseemly, 'tis allowable to them to
discourse of what they please.
   <a name="p06970009">
    [009]
   </a>
   For in sooth, as you must know, so out of
joint are the times that
 the judges have deserted the judgment-seat, the
laws are silent, and
 ample licence to preserve his life as best he may is
accorded to each
 and all.
   <a name="p06970010">
    [010]
   </a>
   Wherefore, if you are somewhat less strict of
speech than is
 your wont, not that aught unseemly in act may follow, but
that you
 may afford solace to yourselves and others, I see not how you can
be
 open to reasonable censure on the part of any.
   <a name="p06970011">
    [011]
   </a>
   Furthermore, nought
that has been said from the first day to the present moment has,
 methinks,
in any degree sullied the immaculate honour of your
 company, nor, God
helping us, shall aught ever sully it.
   <a name="p06970012">
    [012]
   </a>
   Besides,
 who is there that knows
not the quality of your honour? which
 were proof, I make no doubt, against
not only the seductive influence
 of diverting discourse, but even the
terror of death.
   <a name="p06970013">
    [013]
   </a>
   And,
 to tell you the truth, whoso wist that you refused
to discourse of
 these light matters for a while, would be apt to suspect
that 'twas
 but for that you had yourselves erred in like sort.
   <a name="p06970014">
    [014]
   </a>
   And truly
a
 goodly honour would you confer upon me, obedient as I have ever
 been to
you, if after making me your king and your lawgiver, you
 were to refuse to
discourse of the theme which I prescribe.
   <a name="p06970015">
    [015]
   </a>
   Away,
 then, with this scruple
fitter for low minds than yours, and let each
 study how she may give us a
goodly story, and Fortune prosper her
 therein.
  </q>
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="p06970016">
   [016]
  </a>
  So spake the
king, and the ladies, hearkening, said that, even as
 he would, so it
should be: whereupon he gave all leave to do as they
  might be
severally minded until the supper-hour.
  <a name="p06970017">
   [017]
  </a>
  The sun was still
 quite high in
the heaven, for they had not enlarged in their discourse:
 wherefore,
Dioneo with the other gallants being set to play
 at dice, Elisa called the
other ladies apart, and said:
  <a name="p06970018">
   [018]
  </a>
  <q direct="unspecified">
   There is a
 nook hard by this place, where
I think none of you has ever been:
 'tis called the Ladies' Vale: whither,
ever since we have been here,
 I have desired to take you, but time meet I
have not found until today,
 when the sun is still so high: if, then, you
are minded to visit
 it, I have no manner of doubt that, when you are
there, you will be
 very glad you came.
  </q>
  <a name="p06970019">
   [019]
  </a>
  The ladies answered that they
were ready,
 and so, saying nought to the young men, they summoned one of
their maids, and set forth; nor had they gone much more than a
 mile, when
they arrived at the Vale of Ladies. They entered it by
 a very strait
gorge, through which there issued a rivulet, clear as
 crystal, and a
sight, than which nought more fair and pleasant,
 especially at that time
when the heat was great, could be imagined,
 met their eyes.
  <a name="p06970020">
   [020]
  </a>
  Within the
valley, as one of them afterwards told
 me, was a plain about half-a-mile
in circumference, and so exactly
 circular that it might have been
fashioned according to the compass,
 though it seemed a work of Nature's
art, not man's: 'twas girdled
 about by six hills of no great height, each
crowned with a palace
 that shewed as a goodly little castle.
  <a name="p06970021">
   [021]
  </a>
  The slopes of
the hills were
 graduated from summit to base after the manner of the
successive
 tiers, ever abridging their circle, that we see in our
theatres;
  <a name="p06970022">
   [022]
  </a>
  and as
 many as fronted the southern rays were all planted so
close with
 vines, olives, almond-trees, cherry-trees, fig-trees and other
fruit-bearing
 trees not a few, that there was not a hand's-breadth of
vacant space.
  <a name="p06970023">
   [023]
  </a>
  Those that fronted the north were in like manner
 covered
with copses of oak saplings, ashes and other trees, as green
 and straight
as might be.
  <a name="p06970024">
   [024]
  </a>
  Besides which, the plain, which was shut
 in on all sides save
that on which the ladies had entered, was full of
 firs, cypresses, and
bay-trees, with here and there a pine, in order
 and symmetry so meet and
excellent as had they been planted by an
 artist, the best that might be
found in that kind; wherethrough,
 even when the sun was in the zenith,
scarce a ray of light might
 reach the ground, which was all one lawn of
the finest turf, pranked
 with the hyacinth and divers other flowers.
  <a name="p06970025">
   [025]
  </a>
  Add
to which--nor was
 there aught there more delightsome--a rivulet that,
issuing from one
  of the gorges between two of the hills,
descended over ledges of
 living rock, making, as it fell, a murmur most
gratifying to the ear,
 and, seen from a distance, shewed as a spray of
finest, powdered
 quick-silver,
  <a name="p06970026">
   [026]
  </a>
  and no sooner reached the little plain,
than 'twas
 gathered into a tiny channel, by which it sped with great
velocity
 to the middle of the plain, where it formed a diminutive lake,
like
 the fishponds that townsfolk sometimes make in their gardens, when
they have occasion for them.
  <a name="p06970027">
   [027]
  </a>
  The lake was not so deep but that a
 man might
stand therein with his breast above the water; and so
 clear, so pellucid
was the water that the bottom, which was of
 the finest gravel, shewed so
distinct, that one, had he wished, who
 had nought better to do, might have
counted the stones. Nor was it
 only the bottom that was to be seen, but
such a multitude of fishes,
 glancing to and fro, as was at once a delight
and a marvel to behold.
  <a name="p06970028">
   [028]
  </a>
  Bank it had none, but its margin was the lawn, to
which it imparted
 a goodlier freshness. So much of the water as it might
not contain
 was received by another tiny channel, through which, issuing
from
 the vale, it glided swiftly to the plain below.
 </p>
 <p>
  <a name="p06970029">
   [029]
  </a>
  To which
pleasaunce the damsels being come surveyed it with
 roving glance, and
finding it commendable, and marking the lake
 in front of them, did, as
'twas very hot, and they deemed themselves
 secure from observation,
resolve to take a bath.
  <a name="p06970030">
   [030]
  </a>
  So, having bidden
 their maid wait and keep watch
over the access to the vale, and give
 them warning, if haply any should
approach it, they all seven undressed
 and got into the water, which to the
whiteness of their flesh
 was even such a veil as fine glass is to the
vermeil of the rose.
  <a name="p06970031">
   [031]
  </a>
  They,
 being thus in the water, the clearness of which
was thereby in no
 wise affected, did presently begin to go hither and
thither after the
 fish, which had much ado where to bestow themselves so
as to
 escape out of their hands.
  <a name="p06970032">
   [032]
  </a>
  In which diversion they spent some time,
and caught a few, and then they hied them out of the water and
 dressed
them again, and bethinking them that 'twas time to return
 to the palace,
they began slowly sauntering thither, dilating much as
 they went upon the
beauty of the place, albeit they could not extol
 it more than they had
already done.
  <a name="p06970033">
   [033]
  </a>
  'Twas still quite early when
 they reached the palace, so
that they found the gallants yet at play
 where they had left them. To whom
quoth Pampinea with a
 smile:
  <q direct="unspecified">
   We have stolen a march upon you
to-day.
  </q>
  <a name="p06970034">
   [034]
  </a>
  <q direct="unspecified">
   So,
  </q>
  replied Dioneo,
  <q direct="unspecified">
   'tis with you do
first and say after?
  </q>
  <a name="p06970035">
   [035]
  </a>
  <q direct="unspecified">
   Ay, my
 lord,
  </q>
  returned Pampinea, and told
him at large whence they came,
 and what the place was like, and how far
'twas off, and what they
 had done.
  <a name="p06970036">
   [036]
  </a>
  What she said of the beauty of the spot
begat in the king
 a desire to see it: wherefore he straightway ordered
supper, whereof
 when all had gaily partaken, the three gallants parted
from the ladies
 and hied them with their servants to the vale, where none
of them
 had ever been before, and, having marked all its beauties,
extolled it
 as scarce to be matched in all the world.
  <a name="p06970037">
   [037]
  </a>
  Then, as the hour
was
 very late, they did but bathe, and as soon as they had resumed their
clothes, returned to the ladies, whom they found dancing a carol to
 an air
that Fiammetta sang, which done, they conversed of the
 Ladies' Vale,
waxing eloquent in praise thereof:
  <a name="p06970038">
   [038]
  </a>
  insomuch that the
 king called the
seneschal, and bade him have some beds made ready
 and carried thither on
the morrow, that any that were so minded
 might there take their siesta.
  <a name="p06970039">
   [039]
  </a>
  He
then had lights and wine and
 comfits brought; and when they had taken a
slight refection, he
 bade all address them to the dance. So at his behest
Pamfilo led a
 dance, and then the king, turning with gracious mien to
Elisa:
  <a name="p06970040">
   [040]
  </a>
  <q direct="unspecified">
   Fair damsel,
  </q>
  quoth he,
  <q direct="unspecified">
   'twas thou to-day didst me this
honour
 of the crown; and 'tis my will that thine to-night be the honour
or
 the song; wherefore sing us whatsoever thou hast most lief.
  </q>
  <a name="p06970041">
   [041]
  </a>
  <q direct="unspecified">
   That gladly will I,
  </q>
  replied Elisa smiling; and thus with dulcet
voice began:

whereat all
 wondered exceedingly, nor might any conjecture wherefore she
so
 sang.

  But the king, who was in a jolly humour, sent for Tindaro,
 and
bade him out with his cornemuse, and caused them tread many a
 measure
thereto, until, no small part of the night being thus spent,
 he gave leave
to all to betake them to rest.
