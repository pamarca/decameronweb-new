 when the author has set forth, how it came to pass
 that the persons, who appear hereafter, met together
 for interchange of discourse, they, under the rule of
 Pampinea, discourse of such matters as most commend
 themselves to each in turn.</p></argument><div2 type="introduction" who="author" id="d01intro"><head>Introduction</head><p><milestone id="p01980002" />As often, most gracious ladies, as I bethink me, how compassionate
 you are by nature one and all, I do not disguise from
 myself that the present work must seem to you to have but a
 heavy and distressful prelude, in that it bears upon its very front
 what must needs revive the sorrowful memory of the late mortal
 pestilence, the course whereof was grievous not merely to eyewitnesses
 but to all who in any other wise had cognisance of it.
      <milestone id="p01980003" />But I would have you know, that you need not therefore be fearful
 to read further, as if your reading were ever to be accompanied
 by sighs and tears. <milestone id="p01980004" />This horrid beginning will be to you even
 such as to wayfarers is a steep and rugged mountain, beyond which
 stretches a plain most fair and delectable, which the toil of the ascent
 and descent does but serve to render more agreeable to them; <milestone id="p01980005" />for, as
 the last degree of joy brings with it sorrow, so misery has ever its
 sequel of happiness. <milestone id="p01980006" />To this brief exordium of woe--brief, I say,
 inasmuch as it can be put within the compass of a few letters--succeed
 forthwith the sweets and delights which I have promised you, and
 which, perhaps, had I not done so, were not to have been expected
 from it. <milestone id="p01980007" />In truth, had it been honestly possible to guide you whither
 I would bring you by a road less rough than this will be, I would
 gladly have so done. But, because without this review of the past, it
 would not be in my power to shew how the matters, of which you
 <pb n="5" />will hereafter read, came to pass, I am almost bound of necessity to
 enter upon it, if I would write of them at all.</p><p><milestone id="p01980008" />I say, then, that the years of the beatific incarnation of the Son
 of God had reached the tale of one thousand three hundred and
 forty-eight, when in the illustrious city of Florence, the fairest of all
 the cities of Italy, there made its appearance that deadly pestilence,
 which, whether disesminated by the influence of the celestial bodies,
 or sent upon us mortals by God in His just wrath by way of
 retribution for our iniquities, had had its origin some years before in
 the East, whence, after destroying an innumerable multitude of living
 beings, it had propagated itself without respite from place to place,
 and so, calamitously, had spread into the West.</p><p><milestone id="p01980009" />In Florence, despite all that human wisdom and forethought could
 devise to avert it, as the cleansing of the city from many impurities
 by officials appointed for the purpose, the refusal of entrance to all
 sick folk, and the adoption of many precautions for the preservation
 of health; despite also humble supplications addressed to God, and
 often repeated both in public procession and otherwise, by the devout;
 towards the beginning of the spring of the said year the doleful
 effects of the pestilence began to be horribly apparent by symptoms
 that shewed as if miraculous.</p><p><milestone id="p01980010" />Not such were they as in the East, where an issue of blood from
 the nose was a manifest sign of inevitable death; but in men and
 women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain
 tumours in the groin or the armpits, some of which grew as large as
 a common apple, others as an egg, some more, some less, which the
 common folk called gavoccioli. <milestone id="p01980011" />From the two said parts of the
 body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself
 in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady
 began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in
 many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large,
 now minute and numerous. <milestone id="p01980012" />And as the gavocciolo had been and
 still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were
 these spots on whomsoever they shewed themselves. <milestone id="p01980013" />Which maladies
 seemed to set entirely at naught both the art of the physician and
 the virtues of physic; indeed, whether it was that the disorder was
 of a nature to defy such treatment, or that the physicians were at
 fault--besides the qualified there was now a multitude both of men
 <pb n="6" />and of women who practised without having received the slightest
 tincture of medical science--and, being in ignorance of its source,
 failed to apply the proper remedies; in either case, not merely were
 those that recovered few, but almost all within three days from the
 appearance of the said symptoms, sooner or later, died, and in most
 cases without any fever or other attendant malady.</p><p><milestone id="p01980014" />Moreover, the virulence of the pest was the greater by reason that
 intercourse was apt to convey it from the sick to the whole, just as
 fire devours things dry or greasy when they are brought close to it.
 <milestone id="p01980015" />Nay, the evil went yet further, for not merely by speech or association
 with the sick was the malady communicated to the healthy with
 consequent peril of common death; but any that touched the clothes
 of the sick or aught else that had been touched or used by them,
 seemed thereby to contract the disease.</p><p><milestone id="p01980016" />So marvellous sounds that which I have now to relate, that, had
 not many, and I among them, observed it with their own eyes, I had
 hardly dared to credit it, much less to set it down in writing, though
 I had had it from the lips of a credible witness.</p><p><milestone id="p01980017" />I say, then, that such was the energy of the contagion of the said
 pestilence, that it was not merely propagated from man to man,
 but, what is much more startling, it was frequently observed, that
 things which had belonged to one sick or dead of the disease, if
 touched by some other living creature, not of the human species,
 were the occasion, not merely of sickening, but of an almost instantaneous
 death. <milestone id="p01980018" />Whereof my own eyes (as I said a little before) had
 cognisance, one day among others, by the following experience. The
 rags of a poor man who had died of the disease being strewn about
 the open street, two hogs came thither, and after, as is their wont,
 no little trifling with their snouts, took the rags between their
 teeth and tossed them to and fro about their chaps; whereupon,
 almost immediately, they gave a few turns, and fell down dead,
 as if by poison, upon the rags which in an evil hour they had
 disturbed.</p><p><milestone id="p01980019" />In which circumstances, not to speak of many others of a similar
 or even graver complexion, divers apprehensions and imaginations
 were engendered in the minds of such as were left alive, inclining
 almost all of them to the same harsh resolution, to wit, to shun and
 abhor all contact with the sick and all that belonged to them,
 <pb n="7" />thinking thereby to make each his own health secure. <milestone id="p01980020" />Among whom
 there were those who thought that to live temperately and avoid all
 excess would count for much as a preservative against seizures of this
 kind. Wherefore they banded together, and, dissociating themselves
 from all others, formed communities in houses where there were no
 sick, and lived a separate and secluded life, which they regulated with
 the utmost care, avoiding every kind of luxury, but eating and
 drinking very moderately of the most delicate viands and the finest
 wines, holding converse with none but one another, lest tidings of
 sickness or death should reach them, and diverting their minds with
 music and such other delights as they could devise. <milestone id="p01980021" />Others, the bias
 of whose minds was in the opposite direction, maintained, that to
 drink freely, frequent places of public resort, and take their pleasure
 with song and revel, sparing to satisfy no appetite, and to laugh and
 mock at no event, was the sovereign remedy for so great an evil: and
 that which they affirmed they also put in practice, so far as they were
 able, resorting day and night, now to this tavern, now to that, drinking
 with an entire disregard of rule or measure, and by preference making
 the houses of others, as it were, their inns, if they but saw in them
 aught that was particularly to their taste or liking; <milestone id="p01980022" />which they were
 readily able to do, because the owners, seeing death imminent, had
 become as reckless of their property as of their lives; so that most of
 the houses were open to all comers, and no distinction was observed
 between the stranger who presented himself and the rightful lord.
 Thus, adhering ever to their inhuman determination to shun the sick,
 as far as possible, they ordered their life. <milestone id="p01980023" />In this extremity of our
 city's suffering and tribulation the venerable authority of laws,
 human and divine, was abased and all but totally dissolved, for lack
 of those who should have administered and enforced them, most of
 whom, like the rest of the citizens, were either dead or sick, or so
 hard bested for servants that they were unable to execute any
 office; whereby every man was free to do what was right in his
 own eyes.</p><p><milestone id="p01980024" />Not a few there were who belonged to neither of the two said
 parties, but kept a middle course between them, neither laying the
 same restraint upon their diet as the former, nor allowing themselves
 the same license in drinking and other dissipations as the latter, but
 living with a degree of freedom sufficient to satisfy their appetites,
 <pb n="8" />and not as recluses. They therefore walked abroad, carrying in
 their hands flowers or fragrant herbs or divers sorts of spices, which
 they frequently raised to their noses, deeming it an excellent thing
 thus to comfort the brain with such perfumes, because the air seemed
 to be everywhere laden and reeking with the stench emitted by the
 dead and the dying, and the odours of drugs.</p><p><milestone id="p01980025" />Some again, the most sound, perhaps, in judgment, as they were
 also the most harsh in temper, of all, affirmed that there was no
 medicine for the disease superior or equal in efficacy to flight; following
 which prescription a multitude of men and women, negligent
 of all but themselves, deserted their city, their houses, their estates,
 their kinsfolk, their goods, and went into voluntary exile, or migrated
 to the country parts, as if God in visiting men with this pestilence in
 requital of their iniquities would not pursue them with His wrath
 wherever they might be, but intended the destruction of such alone
 as remained within the circuit of the walls of the city; or deeming,
 perchance, that it was now time for all to flee from it, and that its
 last hour was come.</p><p><milestone id="p01980026" />Of the adherents of these divers opinions not all died, neither did
 all escape; but rather there were, of each sort and in every place, many
 that sickened, and by those who retained their health were treated after
 the example which they themselves, while whole, had set, being everywhere
 left to languish in almost total neglect. <milestone id="p01980027" />Tedious were it to
 recount, how citizen avoided citizen, how among neighbours was
 scarce found any that shewed fellow-feeling for another, how kinsfolk
 held aloof, and never met, or but rarely; enough that this sore affliction
 entered so deep into the minds of men and women, that in the
 horror thereof brother was forsaken by brother, nephew by uncle,
 brother by sister, and oftentimes husband by wife; nay, what is more,
 and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to abandon
 their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate, as if they had
 been strangers. <milestone id="p01980028" />Wherefore the sick of both sexes, whose number
 could not be estimated, were left without resource but in the charity
 of friends (and few such there were), or the interest of servants, who
 were hardly to be had at high rates and on unseemly terms, and
 being, moreover, one and all, men and women of gross understanding,
 and for the most part unused to such offices, concerned themselves
 no further than to supply the immediate and expressed wants of the
 <pb n="9" />sick, and to watch them die; in which service they themselves not
 seldom perished with their gains. <milestone id="p01980029" />In consequence of which dearth
 of servants and dereliction of the sick by neighbours, kinsfolk and
 friends, it came to pass--a thing, perhaps, never before heard of--that
 no woman, however dainty, fair or well-born she might be,
 shrank, when stricken with the disease, from the ministrations of a
 man, no matter whether he were young or no, or scrupled to expose
 to him every part of her body, with no more shame than if he had
 been a woman, submitting of necessity to that which her malady
 required; wherefrom, perchance, there resulted in after time some
 loss of modesty in such as recovered. <milestone id="p01980030" />Besides which many succumbed,
 who with proper attendance, would, perhaps, have escaped
 death; so that, what with the virulence of the plague and the lack
 of due tendance of the sick, the multitude of the deaths, that daily
 and nightly took place in the city, was such that those who heard
 the tale--not to say witnessed the fact--were struck dumb with
      amazement. <milestone id="p01980031" />Whereby, practices contrary to the former habits of
 the citizens could hardly fail to grow up among the survivors.</p><p><milestone id="p01980032" />It had been, as to-day it still is, the custom for the women that
 were neighbours and of kin to the deceased to gather in his house
 with the women that were most closely connected with him, to
 wail with them in common, while on the other hand his male kinsfolk
 and neighbours, with not a few of the other citizens, and a due
 proportion of the clergy according to his quality, assembled without,
 in front of the house, to receive the corpse; and so the dead man
 was borne on the shoulders of his peers, with funeral pomp of taper
 and dirge, to the church selected by him before his death. <milestone id="p01980033" />Which
 rites, as the pestilence waxed in fury, were either in whole or in
 great part disused, and gave way to others of a novel order. <milestone id="p01980034" />For
 not only did no crowd of women surround the bed of the dying, but
 many passed from this life unregarded, and few indeed were they to
 whom were accorded the lamentations and bitter tears of sorrowing
 relations; nay, for the most part, their place was taken by the laugh,
 the jest, the festal gathering; observances which the women, domestic
 piety in large measure set aside, had adopted with very great
 advantage to their health. <milestone id="p01980035" />Few also there were whose bodies were
 attended to the church by more than ten or twelve of their neighbours,
 and those not the honourable and respected citizens; but a sort
 <pb n="10" />of corpse-carriers drawn from the baser ranks, who called themselves
 becchini<note>Probably from the name of the pronged or hooked implement
 with
 which they dragged the corpses out of the houses.</note> and performed such
 offices for hire, would shoulder the
 bier, and with hurried steps carry it, not to the church of the dead
 man's choice, but to that which was nearest at hand, with four or
 six priests in front and a candle or two, or, perhaps, none; nor did
 the priests distress themselves with too long and solemn an office,
 but with the aid of the becchini hastily consigned the corpse to the
 first tomb which they found untenanted. <milestone id="p01980036" />The condition of the
 lower, and, perhaps, in great measure of the middle ranks, of the
 people shewed even worse and more deplorable; for, deluded by
 hope or constrained by poverty, they stayed in their quarters, in their
 houses, where they sickened by thousands a day, and, being without
 service or help of any kind, were, so to speak, irredeemably devoted
 to the death which overtook them. <milestone id="p01980037" />Many died daily or nightly in
 the public streets; of many others, who died at home, the departure
 was hardly observed by their neighbours, until the stench of their
 putrefying bodies carried the tidings; and what with their corpses
 and the corpses of others who died on every hand the whole place
 was a sepulchre.</p><p><milestone id="p01980038" />It was the common practice of most of the neighbours, moved no
 less by fear of contamination by the putrefying bodies than by charity
 towards the deceased, <milestone id="p01980039" />to drag the corpses out of the houses with their
 own hands, aided, perhaps, by a porter, if a porter was to be had, and
 to lay them in front of the doors, where any one who made the
 round might have seen, especially in the morning, more of them than
 he could count; afterwards they would have biers brought up, or, in
 default, planks, whereon they laid them. Nor was it once or twice
 only that one and the same bier carried two or three corpses at once;
 but quite a considerable number of such cases occurred, one bier
 sufficing for husband and wife, two or three brothers, father and son,
 and so forth. <milestone id="p01980040" />And times without number it happened, that, as two
 priests, bearing the cross, were on their way to perform the last office
 for some one, three or four biers were brought up by the porters in
 rear of them, so that, whereas the priests supposed that they had
 but one corpse to bury, they discovered that there were six or
 eight, or sometimes more. <milestone id="p01980041" />Nor, for all their number, were their
 <pb n="11" />obsequies honoured by either tears or lights or crowds of mourners;
 rather, it was come to this, that a dead man was then of no more
 account than a dead goat would be to-day. From all which it is
 abundantly manifest, that that lesson of patient resignation, which
 the sages were never able to learn from the slight and infrequent
 mishaps which occur in the natural course of events, was now brought
 home even to the minds of the simple by the magnitude of their
 disasters, so that they became indifferent to them.</p><p><milestone id="p01980042" />As consecrated ground there was not in extent sufficient to
 provide tombs for the vast multitude of corpses which day and night,
 and almost every hour, were brought in eager haste to the churches
 for interment, least of all, if ancient custom were to be observed and
 a separate resting-place assigned to each, they dug, for each graveyard,
 as soon as it was full, a huge trench, in which they laid the
 corpses as they arrived by hundreds at a time, piling them up as
 merchandise is stowed in the hold of a ship, tier upon tier, each
 covered with a little earth, until the trench would hold no more.
 <milestone id="p01980043" />But I spare to rehearse with minute particularity each of the woes
 that came upon our city, and say in brief, that, harsh as was the
 tenor of her fortunes, the surrounding country knew no mitigation;
 for there--not to speak of the castles, each, as it were, a little city in
 itself--in sequestered village, or on the open champaign, by the wayside,
 on the farm, in the homestead, the poor hapless husbandmen
 and their families, forlorn of physicians' care or servants' tendance,
 perished day and night alike, not as men, but rather as beasts.
 <milestone id="p01980044" />Wherefore, they too, like the citizens, abandoned all rule of life, all
 habit of industry, all counsel of prudence; nay, one and all, as if
 expecting each day to be their last, not merely ceased to aid Nature
 to yield her fruit in due season of their beasts and their lands and
 their past labours, but left no means unused, which ingenuity could
 devise, to waste their accumulated store; <milestone id="p01980045" />denying shelter to their
 oxen, asses, sheep, goats, pigs, fowls, nay, even to their dogs, man's
 most faithful companions, and driving them out into the fields to
 roam at large amid the unsheaved, nay, unreaped corn. <milestone id="p01980046" />Many of
 which, as if endowed with reason, took their fill during the day, and
 returned home at night without any guidance of herdsman. <milestone id="p01980047" />But
 enough of the country! What need we add, but (reverting to the
 city) that such and so grievous was the harshness of heaven, and
 <pb n="12" />perhaps in some degree of man, that, what with the fury of the
 pestilence, the panic of those whom it spared, and their consequent
 neglect or desertion of not a few of the stricken in their need, it is
 believed without any manner of doubt, that between March and the
 ensuing July upwards of a hundred thousand human beings lost their
 lives within the walls of the city of Florence, which before the
 deadly visitation would not have been supposed to contain so many
 people! <milestone id="p01980048" />How many grand palaces, how many stately homes, how
 many splendid residences, once full of retainers, of lords, of ladies,
 were now left desolate of all, even to the meanest servant! How
 many families of historic fame, of vast ancestral domains, and wealth
 proverbial, found now no scion to continue the succession! How
 many brave men, how many fair ladies, how many gallant youths,
 whom any physician, were he Galen, Hippocrates, or &#198;sculapius
 himself, would have pronounced in the soundest of health, broke fast
 with their kinsfolk, comrades and friends in the morning, and when
 evening came, supped with their forefathers in the other world!</p><p><milestone id="p01980049" />Irksome it is to myself to rehearse in detail so sorrowful a history.
 Wherefore, being minded to pass over so much thereof as I fairly
 can, I say, that our city, being thus well-nigh depopulated, it so
 happened, as I afterwards learned from one worthy of credit, that
 on a Tuesday morning after Divine Service the venerable church of
 Santa Maria Novella was almost deserted save for the presence of
 seven young ladies habited sadly in keeping with the season. All
 were connected either by blood or at least as friends or neighbours;
 and fair and of good understanding were they all, as also of noble
 birth, gentle manners, and a modest sprightliness. In age none
 exceeded twenty-eight, or fell short of eighteen years. <milestone id="p01980050" />Their names
 I would set down in due form, had I not good reason to withhold
 them, being solicitous lest the matters which here ensue, as told
 and heard by them, should in after time be occasion of reproach to
 any of them, in view of the ample indulgence which was then, for the
 reasons heretofore set forth, accorded to the lighter hours of persons of
 much riper years than they, but which the manners of to-day have
 somewhat restricted; nor would I furnish material to detractors,
 ever ready to bestow their bite where praise is due, to cast by invidious
 speech the least slur upon the honour of these noble ladies. <milestone id="p01980051" />Wherefore,
 that what each says may be apprehended without confusion, I
 <pb n="13" />intend to give them names more or less appropriate to the character
 of each. The first, then, being the eldest of the seven, we will call
 Pampinea, the second Fiammetta, the third Filomena, the fourth
 Emilia, the fifth we will distinguish as Lauretta, the sixth as Neifile,
 and the last, not without reason, shall be named Elisa.</p><p><milestone id="p01980052" />'Twas not of set purpose but by mere chance that these ladies met
 in the same part of the church; but at length grouping themselves
 into a sort of circle, after heaving a few sighs, they gave up saying
 paternosters, and began to converse (among other topics) on the
 times.</p><p><milestone id="p01980053" />So they continued for a while, and then Pampinea, the rest listening
 in silent attention, thus began: <q direct="unspecified">Dear ladies mine, often have I
 heard it said, and you doubtless as well as I, that wrong is done to
 none by whoso but honestly uses his reason. And to fortify, preserve,
 and defend his life to the utmost of his power is the dictate of natural
 reason in every one that is born. Which right is accorded in such
 measure that in defence thereof men have been held blameless in
 taking life. <milestone id="p01980054" />And if this be allowed by the laws, albeit on their
 stringency depends the well-being of every mortal, how much more
 exempt from censure should we, and all other honest folk, be in
 taking such means as we may for the preservation of our life? <milestone id="p01980055" />As
 often as I bethink me how we have been occupied this morning, and
 not this morning only, and what has been the tenor of our conversation,
 I perceive--and you will readily do the like--that each of
 us is apprehensive on her own account; nor thereat do I marvel, but
 at this I do marvel greatly, that, though none of us lacks a woman's
 wit, yet none of us has recourse to any means to avert that which
 we all justly fear. <milestone id="p01980056" />Here we tarry, as if, methinks, for no other
 purpose than to bear witness to the number of the corpses that are
 brought hither for interment, or to hearken if the brothers there
 within, whose number is now almost reduced to nought, chant their
 offices at the canonical hours, or, by our weeds of woe, to obtrude on
 the attention of every one that enters, the nature and degree of our
 sufferings. <milestone id="p01980057" />And if we quit the church, we see dead or sick folk carried
 about,
 or we see those, who for their crimes were of late condemned to
 exile by the outraged majesty of the public laws, but who now, in
 contempt of those laws, well knowing that their ministers are a prey
 <pb n="14" />to death or disease, have returned, and traverse the city in packs,
 making it hideous with their riotous antics; or else we see the refuse
 of the people, fostered on our blood, becchini, as they call themselves,
 who for our torment go prancing about here and there and everywhere,
 making mock of our miseries in scurrilous songs. <milestone id="p01980058" />Nor hear
 we aught but: Such and such are dead; or, Such and such are
 dying; and should hear dolorous wailing on every hand, were there
 but any to wail. <milestone id="p01980059" />Or go we home, what see we there? I know not
 if you are in like case with me; but there, where once were servants
 in plenty, I find none left but my maid, and shudder with terror, and
 feel the very hairs of my head to stand on end; and turn or tarry
 where I may, I encounter the ghosts of the departed, not with their
 wonted mien, but with something horrible in their aspect that appals
 me. <milestone id="p01980060" />For which reasons church and street and home are alike distressful
 to me, and the more so that none, methinks, having means and place
 of retirement as we have, abides here save only we; <milestone id="p01980061" />or if any such
 there be, they are of those, as my senses too often have borne witness,
 who make no distinction between things honourable and their
 opposites, so they but answer the cravings of appetite, and, alone or
 in company, do daily and nightly what things soever give promise of
 most gratification. <milestone id="p01980062" />Nor are these secular persons alone; but such as
 live recluse in monasteries break their rule, and give themselves up
 to carnal pleasures, persuading themselves that they are permissible
 to them, and only forbidden to others, and, thereby thinking to
 escape, are become unchaste and dissolute. <milestone id="p01980063" />If such be our circumstances--and
 such most manifestly they are--what do we here?
 what wait we for? what dream we of? why are we less prompt to
 provide for our own safety than the rest of the citizens? Is life less
 dear to us than to all other women? or think we that the bond
 which unites soul and body is stronger in us than in others, so that
 there is no blow that may light upon it, of which we need be
 apprehensive? <milestone id="p01980064" />If so, we err, we are deceived. What insensate folly
 were it in us so to believe! We have but to call to mind the
 number and condition of those, young as we, and of both sexes, who
 have succumbed to this cruel pestilence, to find therein conclusive
 evidence to the contrary. <milestone id="p01980065" />And lest from lethargy or indolence we
 fall into the vain imagination that by some lucky accident we may
 in some way or another, when we would, escape--I know not if
 <pb n="15" />your opinion accord with mine--I should deem it most wise in us,
 our case being what it is, if, as many others have done before us, and
 are still doing, we were to quit this place, and, shunning like death
 the evil example of others, betake ourselves to the country, and there
 live as honourable women on one of the estates, of which none of us
 has any lack, with all cheer of festal gathering and other delights, so
 long as in no particular we overstep the bounds of reason. <milestone id="p01980066" />There we
 shall hear the chant of birds, have sight of verdant hills and plains, of
 cornfields undulating like the sea, of trees of a thousand sorts; there
 also we shall have a larger view of the heavens, which, however harsh
 to usward, yet deny not their eternal beauty; things fairer far for
 epe to rest on than the desolate walls of our city. <milestone id="p01980067" />Moreover, we
 shall there breathe a fresher air, find ampler store of things meet for
 such as live in these times, have fewer causes of annoy. <milestone id="p01980068" />For, though
 the husbandmen die there, even as here the citizens, they are
 dispersed in scattered homesteads, and 'tis thus less painful to witness.
 <milestone id="p01980069" />Nor, so far as I can see, is there a soul here whom we shall desert;
 rather we may truly say, that we are ourselves deserted; for, our
 kinsfolk being either dead or fled in fear of death, no more regardful
 of us than if we were strangers, we are left alone in our great
 affliction. <milestone id="p01980070" />No censure, then, can fall on us if we do as I propose;
 and otherwise grievous suffering, perhaps death, may ensue. <milestone id="p01980071" />Wherefore,
 if you agree, 'tis my advice, that, attended by our maids with al???
 things needful, we sojourn, now on this, now on the other estate,
 and in such way of life continue, until we see--if death should not
 first overtake us--the end which Heaven reserves for these events.
 <milestone id="p01980072" />And I remind you that it will be at least as seemly in us to leave
 with honour, as in others, of whom there are not a few, to stay with
 dishonour.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01980073" />The other ladies praised Pampinea's plan, and indeed were so
 prompt to follow it, that they had already begun to discuss the
 manner in some detail, as if they were forthwith to rise from their
 seats and take the road, <milestone id="p01980074" />when Filomena, whose judgment was
 excellent, interposed, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Ladies, though Pampinea has spoken
 to most excellent effect, yet it were not well to be so precipitate as
 you seem disposed to be. Bethink you that we are all women; nor
 is there any here so young, but she is of years to understand how
 women are minded towards one another, when they are alone
 <pb n="16" />together, and how ill they are able to rule themselves without the
 guidance of some man. <milestone id="p01980075" />We are sensitive, perverse, suspicious,
 pusillanimous and timid; wherefore I much misdoubt, that, if we
 find no other guidance than our own, this company is like to break
 up sooner, and with less credit to us, than it should. Against which
 it were well to provide at the outset.</q> <milestone id="p01980076" />Said then Elisa: 
      <q direct="unspecified">Without
 doubt man is woman's head, and, without man's governance, it is
 seldom that aught that we do is brought to a commendable conclusion.
 But how are we to come by the men? <milestone id="p01980077" />Every one of us
 here knows that her kinsmen are for the most part dead, and that the
 survivors are dispersed, one here, one there, we know not where, bent
 each on escaping the same fate as ourselves; nor were it seemly to
 seek the aid of strangers; for, as we are in quest of health, we must
 find some means so to order matters that, wherever we seek diversion
 or repose, trouble and scandal do not follow us.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01980078" />While the ladies were thus conversing, there came into the church
 three young men, young, I say, but not so young that the age of the
 youngest was less than twenty-five years; in whom neither the
 sinister course of events, nor the loss of friends or kinsfolk, nor fear
 for their own safety, had availed to quench, or even temper, the
 ardour of their love. <milestone id="p01980079" />The first was called Pamfilo, the second
 Filostrato, and the third Dioneo. Very debonair and chivalrous
 were they all; and in this troublous time they were seeking if haply,
 to their exceeding great solace, they might have sight of their fair
 friends, all three of whom chanced to be among the said seven ladies,
 besides some that were of kin to the young men. <milestone id="p01980080" />At one and the
 same moment they recognised the ladies and were recognised by
 them: wherefore, with a gracious smile, Pampinea thus began:
 <q direct="unspecified">Lo, fortune is propitious to our enterprise, having vouchsafed us the
 good offices of these young men, who are as gallant as they are
 discreet, and will gladly give us their guidance and escort, so we but
 take them into our service.</q> <milestone id="p01980081" />Whereupon Neifile, crimson from brow
 to neck with the blush of modesty, being one of those that had a
 lover among the young men, said: <milestone id="p01980082" /><q direct="unspecified">For God's sake, Pampinea,
 have a care what you say. Well assured am I that nought but good
 can be said of any of them, and I deem them fit for office far more
 onerous than this which you propose for them, and their good and
 honourable company worthy of ladies fairer by far and more tenderly
 <pb n="17" />to be cherished than such as we. <milestone id="p01980083" />But 'tis no secret that they love
 some of us here; wherefore I misdoubt that, if we take them with
 us, we may thereby give occasion for scandal and censure merited
 neither by us nor by them.</q> <milestone id="p01980084" /><q direct="unspecified">That,</q> said Filomena, <q direct="unspecified">is of no
 consequence;
 so I but live honestly, my conscience gives me no
 disquietude; if others asperse me, God and the truth will take arms
 in my defence. <milestone id="p01980085" />Now, should they be disposed to attend us, of a truth
 we might say with Pampinea, that fortune favours our enterprise.</q>
 <milestone id="p01980086" />The silence which followed betokened consent on the part of the other
 ladies, who then with one accord resolved to call the young men, and
 acquaint them with their purpose, and pray them to be of their company.
 <milestone id="p01980087" />So without further parley Pampinea, who had a kinsman
 among the young men, rose and approached them where they stood
 intently regarding them; and greeting them gaily, she opened to them
 their plan, and besought them on the part of herself and her friends
 to join their company on terms of honourable and fraternal comradeship.
 <milestone id="p01980088" />At first the young men thought she did but trifle with them;
 but when they saw that she was in earnest, they answered with
 alacrity that they were ready, and promptly, even before they left
 the church, set matters in train for their departure. <milestone id="p01980089" />So all things
 meet being first sent forward in due order to their intended place
 of sojourn, the ladies with some of their maids, and the three young
 men, each attended by a man-servant, sallied forth of the city on
 the morrow, being Wednesday, about daybreak, and took the road;
 nor had they journeyed more than two short miles when they
 arrived at their destination. <milestone id="p01980090" />The estate<note>Identified by tradition with
 the Villa Palmieri (now Crawford) on the
 slope of Fiesole.</note> lay upon a little hill some
 distance from the nearest highway, and, embowered in shrubberies
 of divers hues, and other greenery, afforded the eye a pleasant
 prospect. <milestone id="p01980091" />On the summit of the hill was a palace with galleries,
 halls and chambers, disposed around a fair and spacious court, each
 very fair in itself, and the goodlier to see for the gladsome pictures
 with which it was adorned; the whole set amidst meads and gardens
 laid out with marvellous art, wells of the coolest water, and vaults of
 the finest wines, things more suited to dainty drinkers than to sober
 and honourable women. On their arrival the company, to their no
 small delight, found their beds already made, the rooms well swept
 <pb n="18" />and garnished with flowers of every sort that the season could afford,
 and the floors carpeted with rushes. <milestone id="p01980092" />When they were seated,
 Dioneo, a gallant who had not his match for courtesy and wit, spoke
 thus: <q direct="unspecified">My ladies, 'tis not our forethought so much as your own
 mother-wit that has guided us hither. <milestone id="p01980093" />How you mean to dispose
 of your cares I know not; mine I left behind me within the citygate
 when I issued thence with you a brief while ago. Wherefore,
 I pray you, either address yourselves to make merry, to laugh and
 sing with me (so far, I mean, as may consist with your dignity), or
 give me leave to hie me back to the stricken city, there to abide
 with my cares.</q> <milestone id="p01980094" />To whom blithely Pampinea replied, as if she too
 had cast off all her cares: <q direct="unspecified">Well sayest thou, Dioneo, excellent
 well; gaily we mean to live; 'twas a refuge from sorrow that here
 we sought, nor had we other cause to come hither. <milestone id="p01980095" />But, as no
 anarchy can long endure, I who initiated the deliberations of which
 this fair company is the fruit, do now, to the end that our joy may
 be lasting, deem it expedient, that there be one among us in chief
 authority, honoured and obeyed by us as our superior, whose
 exclusive care it shall be to devise how we may pass our time
 blithely. <milestone id="p01980096" />And that each in turn may prove the weight of the care,
 as well as enjoy the pleasure, of sovereignty, and, no distinction being
 made of sex, envy be felt by none by reason of exclusion from the
 office; I propose, that the weight and honour be borne by each one
 for a day; and let the first to bear sway be chosen by us all,
 those that follow to be appointed towards the vesper hour by him
 or her who shall have had the signory for that day; and let each
 holder of the signory be, for the time, sole arbiter of the place and
 manner in which we are to pass our time.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01980097" />Pampinea's speech was received with the utmost applause, and
 with one accord she was chosen queen for the first day. Whereupon
 Filomena hied her lightly to a bay-tree, having often heard of the
 great honour in which its leaves, and such as were deservedly
 crowned therewith, were worthy to be holden; and having gathered
 a few sprays, she made thereof a goodly wreath of honour, and set
 it on Pampinea's head; which wreath was thenceforth, while
 their company endured, the visible sign of the wearer's sway and
 sovereignty.</p><p><milestone id="p01980098" />No sooner was Queen Pampinea crowned than she bade all be
 <pb n="19" />silent. She then caused summon to her presence their four maids,
 and the servants of the three young men, and, all keeping silence,
 said to them: <q direct="unspecified">That I may shew you all at once, how,
 well still giving place to better, our company may flourish and
 endure, as long as it shall pleasure us, with order meet and assured
 delight and without reproach, I first of all constitute Dioneo's man,
 Parmeno, my seneschal, and entrust him with the care and control
 of all our household, and all that belongs to the service of the hall.
 <milestone id="p01980099" />Pamfilo's man, Sirisco, I appoint treasurer and chancellor of our
 exchequer; and be he ever answerable to Parmeno. While Parmeno
 and Sirisco are too busy about their duties to serve their masters,
 let Filostrato's man, Tindaro, have charge of the chambers of all
 three. <milestone id="p01980100" />My maid, Misia, and Filomena's maid, Licisca, will keep in
 the kitchen, and with all due diligence prepare such dishes as
 Parmeno shall bid them. <milestone id="p01980101" />Lauretta's maid, Chimera, and Fiammetta's
 maid, Stratilia we make answerable for the ladies' chambers, and
 wherever we may take up our quarters, let them see that all is
 spotless. And now we enjoin you, one and all alike, as you value
 our favour, that none of you, go where you may, return whence
 you may, hear or see what you may, bring us any tidings but such as
 be cheerful.</q> <milestone id="p01980102" />These orders thus succinctly given were received with
 universal approval. Whereupon Pampinea rose, and said gaily:
 <q direct="unspecified">Here are gardens, meads, and other places delightsome enough,
 where you may wander at will, and take your pleasure; but on the
 stroke of tierce,<note>The canonical hour following prime, roughly speaking
 about 9 a.m.</note> let all be here to breakfast in the shade.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01980103" />Thus dismissed by their new queen the gay company sauntered
 gently through a garden, the young men saying sweet things to the
 fair ladies, who wove fair garlands of divers sorts of leaves and sang
 love-songs.</p><p><milestone id="p01980104" />Having thus spent the time allowed them by the queen, they
 returned to the house, where they found that Parmeno had entered
 on his office with zeal; for in a hall on the ground-floor they saw
 tables covered with the whitest of cloths, and beakers that shone
 like silver, and sprays of broom scattered everywhere. So, at the bidding
 of the queen, they washed their hands, and all took their places
 as marshalled by Parmeno. <milestone id="p01980105" />Dishes, daintily prepared, were served,
 <pb n="20" />and the finest wines were at hand; the three serving-men did their
 office noiselessly; in a word all was fair and ordered in a seemly
 manner; <milestone id="p01980106" />whereby the spirits of the company rose, and they
 seasoned their viands with pleasant jests and sprightly sallies.
 Breakfast done, the tables were removed, and the queen bade fetch
 instruments of music; for all, ladies and young men alike, knew
 how to tread a measure, and some of them played and sang with
 great skill: so, at her command, Dioneo having taken a lute, and
 Fiammetta a viol, they struck up a dance in sweet concert; <milestone id="p01980107" />and,
 the servants being dismissed to their repast, the queen, attended by
 the other ladies and the two young men, led off a stately carol; which
 ended they fell to singing ditties dainty and gay. <milestone id="p01980108" />Thus they diverted
 themselves until the queen, deeming it time to retire to rest, dismissed
 them all for the night. So the three young men and the
 ladies withdrew to their several quarters, which were in different
 parts of the palace. There they found the beds well made, and
 abundance of flowers, as in the hall; and so they undressed, and
 went to bed.</p><p><milestone id="p01980109" />Shortly after none<note>The canonical hour following sext, i. e. 3
 p.m.</note> the queen rose, and roused the rest of the
 ladies, as also the young men, averring that it was injurious to the
 health to sleep long in the daytime. They therefore hied them to
 a meadow, where the grass grew green and luxuriant, being nowhere
 scorched by the sun, and a light breeze gently fanned them. So at
 the queen's command they all ranged themselves in a circle on the
 grass, and hearkened while she thus spoke:</p><p><milestone id="p01980110" /><q direct="unspecified">You mark that the sun is high, the heat intense, and the silence
 unbroken save by the cicalas among the olive-trees. It were therefore
 the height of folly to quit this spot at present. Here the air
 is cool and the prospect fair, and here, observe, are dice and chess.
 Take, then, your pleasure as you may be severally minded; <milestone id="p01980111" />but, if
 you take my advice, you will find pastime for the hot hours before
 us, not in play, in which the loser must needs be vexed, and
 neither the winner nor the onlooker much the better pleased, but
 in telling of stories, in which the invention of one may afford
 solace to all the company of his hearers. <milestone id="p01980112" />You will not each have
 told a story before the sun will be low, and the heat abated, so that
 <pb n="21" />we shall be able to go and severally take our pleasure where it may
 seem best to each. Wherefore, if my proposal meet with your
 approval--for in this I am disposed to consult your pleasure--let us
 adopt it; if not, divert yourselves as best you may, until the vesper
 hour.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01980113" />The queen's proposal being approved by all, ladies and men alike,
 she added: <milestone id="p01980114" /><q direct="unspecified">So please you, then, I ordain, that, for this first day,
 we be free to discourse of such matters as most commend themselves
 to each in turn.</q> <milestone id="p01980115" />She then addressed Pamfilo, who sat on her
 right hand, bidding him with a gracious air to lead off with one of
 his stories. And prompt at the word of command, Pamfilo, while
 all listened intently, thus began:</p></div2><pb n="22" /><div2 type="novella" who="panfilo" id="nov0101"><head>Novel I</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01010001" />Ser Ciappelletto cheats a holy friar by a false confession,
	and dies; and, having lived as a very bad man,
	is, on his death, reputed a saint, and called San
	Ciappelletto.</p></argument><div3 who="panfilo" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01010002" />A seemly thing it is, dearest ladies, that whatever we do, it be
      begun
      in the holy and awful name of Him who was the maker of all. Wherefore,
      as it falls to me to lead the way in this your enterprise of storytelling,
      I intend to begin with one of His wondrous works, that, by
      hearing thereof, our hopes in Him, in whom is no change, may be
      established, and His name be by us forever lauded. <milestone id="p01010003" />'Tis manifest
      that, as things temporal are all doomed to pass and perish, so within
      and without they abound with trouble and anguish and travail, and
      are subject to infinite perils; nor, save for the especial grace of God,
      should we, whose being is bound up with and forms part of theirs,
      have either the strength to endure or the wisdom to combat their
      adverse influences. <milestone id="p01010004" />By which grace we are visited and penetrated
      (so we must believe) not by reason of any merit of our own, but
      solely out of the fulness of God's own goodness, and in answer to the
      prayers of those who, being mortal like ourselves, did faithfully
      observe His ordinances during their lives, and are now become
      blessed for ever with Him in heaven. To whom, as to advocates
      taught by experience all that belongs to our frailty, we, not daring,
      perchance, to present our petitions in the presence of so great a Judge,
      make known our requests for such things as we deem expedient for
      us. <milestone id="p01010005" />And of His mercy richly abounding to usward we have further
      proof herein, that, no keenness of mortal vision being able in any
      degree to penetrate the secret counsels of the Divine mind, it
      some<pb n="23" />times,
      perchance, happens, that, in error of judgment, we make one
      our advocate before His Majesty, who is banished from His presence
      in eternal exile, and yet He to whom nothing is hidden, having
      regard rather to the sincerity of our prayers than to our ignorance or
      the banishment of the intercessor, hears us no less than if the intercessor
      were in truth one of the blest who enjoy the light of His
      countenance. <milestone id="p01010006" />Which the story that I am about to relate may serve
      to make apparent; apparent, I mean, according to the standard of
      the judgment of man, not of God.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01010007" />The story goes, then, that Musciatto Franzesi, a great and
      wealthy merchant, being made a knight in France, and being to
      attend Charles Sansterre, brother of the King of France, when he
      came into Tuscany at the instance and with the support of Pope
      Boniface, found his affairs, as often happens to merchants, to be
      much involved in divers quarters, and neither easily nor suddenly to
      be adjusted; wherefore he determined to place them in the hands of
      commissioners, and found no difficulty except as to certain credits
      given to some Burgundians, for the recovery of which he doubted
      whether he could come by a competent agent; <milestone id="p01010008" />for well he knew
      that the Burgundians were violent men and ill-conditioned and
      faithless; nor could he call to mind any man so bad that he could
      with confidence oppose his guile to theirs. <milestone id="p01010009" />After long pondering
      the matter, he recollected one Ser Ciapperello da Prato, who much
      frequented his house in Paris. Who being short of stature and very
      affected, the French who knew not the meaning of Cepparello,<note>The
	diminutive of ceppo, stump or log: more commonly written
	cepperello (cf. p. 32) or ceppatello. The form ciapperello
	seems to be found only here.</note> 
      but supposed that it meant the same as Cappello, i. e. garland, in their
      vernacular, called him not Cappello, but Ciappelletto by reason of his
      diminutive size; and as Ciappelletto he was known everywhere,
      whereas few people knew him as Ciapperello. <milestone id="p01010010" />Now Ciappelletto's
      manner of life was thus. He was by profession a notary, and his
      pride was to make false documents; he would have made them as
      often as he was asked, and more readily without fee than another
      at a great price; few indeed he made that were not false, and great
      was his shame when they were discovered. <milestone id="p01010011" />False witness he bore,
      solicited or unsolicited, with boundless delight; and, as oaths were in
      <pb n="24" />those days had in very great respect in France, he, scrupling not to
      forswear himself, corruptly carried the day in every case in which he
      was summoned faithfully to attest the truth. <milestone id="p01010012" />He took inordinate
      delight, and bestirred himself with great zeal, in fomenting ill-feeling,
      enmities, dissensions between friends, kinsfolk and all other folk;
      and the more calamitous were the consequences the better he was
      pleased. <milestone id="p01010013" />Set him on murder, or any other foul crime, and he never
      hesitated, but went about it with alacrity; he had been known on
      more than one occasion to inflict wounds or death by preference
      with his own hands. <milestone id="p01010014" />He was a profuse blasphemer of God and His
      saints, and that on the most trifling occasions, being of all men the
      most irascible. He was never seen at church, held all the sacraments
      vile things, and derided them in language of horrible ribaldry.
      On the other hand he resorted readily to the tavern and other
      places of evil repute, and frequented them. He was as fond of
      women as a dog is of the stick: in the use against nature he had
      not his match among the most abandoned. He would have pilfered
      and stolen as a matter of conscience, as a holy man would make an
      oblation. Most gluttonous he was and inordinately fond of his
      cups, whereby he sometimes brought upon himself both shame and
      suffering. He was also a practised gamester and thrower of false
      dice. <milestone id="p01010015" />But why enlarge so much upon him? Enough that he was,
      perhaps, the worst man that ever was born.</p><p>The rank and power of Musciatto Franzesi had long been this
 reprobate's mainstay, serving in many instances to secure him considerate
 treatment on the part of the private persons whom he
 frequently, and the court which he unremittingly, outraged. <milestone id="p01010016" />So
 Musciatto, having bethought him of this Ser Cepparello, with whose
 way of life he was very well acquainted, judged him to be the very
 sort of person to cope with the guile of the Burgundians. He therefore
 sent for him, and thus addressed him: <milestone id="p01010017" /><q direct="unspecified">Ser Ciappelletto, I am,
 as thou knowest, about to leave this place for good; and among
 those with whom I have to settle accounts are certain Burgundians,
 very wily knaves; nor know I the man whom I could more fitly
 entrust with the recovery of my money than thyself. Wherefore, as
 thou hast nothing to do at present, if thou wilt undertake this
 business, I will procure thee the favour of the court, and give thee a
 reasonable part of what thou shalt recover.</q> <milestone id="p01010018" />Ser Ciappelletto, being
 <pb n="25" />out of employment, and by no means in easy circumstances, and
 about to lose Musciatto, so long his mainstay and support, without
 the least demur, for in truth he had hardly any choice, made his
 mind up and answered that he was ready to go. So the bargain was
 struck. <milestone id="p01010019" />Armed with the power of attorney and the royal letters
 commendatory, Ser Ciappelletto took leave of Messer Musciatto and
 hied him to Burgundy, where he was hardly known to a soul. He
 set about the business which had brought him thither, the recovery
 of the money, in a manner amicable and considerate, foreign to his
 nature, as if he were minded to reserve his severity to the last.
 <milestone id="p01010020" />While thus occupied, he was frequently at the house of two
 Florentine usurers, who treated him with great distinction out of
 regard for Messer Musciatto; and there it so happened that he fell
 sick. The two brothers forthwith placed physicians and servants in
 attendance upon him, and omitted no means meet and apt for the
 restoration of his health. <milestone id="p01010021" />But all remedies proved unavailing; for
 being now old, and having led, as the physicians reported, a disorderly
 life, he went daily from bad to worse like one stricken with a
 mortal disease. This greatly disconcerted the two brothers; <milestone id="p01010022" />and one
 day, hard by the room in which Ser Ciappelletto lay sick, they began
 to talk about him; saying one to the other: <milestone id="p01010023" /><q direct="unspecified">What shall we do
 with this man? We are hard bested indeed on his account. If we
 turn him out of the house, sick as he is, we shall not only incur grave
 censure, but shall evince a signal want of sense; for folk must know
 the welcome we gave him in the first instance, the solicitude with
 which we have had him treated and tended since his illness, during
 which time he could not possibly do aught to displease us, and yet
 they would see him suddenly turned out of our house sick unto
 death. <milestone id="p01010024" />On the other hand he has been so bad a man that he is sure
 not to confess or receive any of the Church's sacraments; and dying
 thus unconfessed, he will be denied burial in church, but will be cast out
 into some ditch like a dog; <milestone id="p01010025" />nay, 'twill be all one if he do confess, for
 such and so horrible have been his crimes that no friar or priest either
 will or can absolve him; and so, dying without absolution, he will
 still be cast out into the ditch. <milestone id="p01010026" />In which case the folk of these parts,
 who reprobate our trade as iniquitous and revile it all day long, and
 would fain rob us, will seize their opportunity, and raise a tumult,
 and make a raid upon our houses, crying: 'A way with these Lombard
 <pb n="26" />dogs, whom the Church excludes from her pale;' and will certainly
 strip us of our goods, and perhaps take our lives also; so that in any
 case we stand to lose if this man die.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01010027" />Ser Ciappelletto, who, as we said, lay close at hand while they
	thus spoke, and whose hearing was sharpened, as is often the case,
	by his malady, overheard all that they said about him. So he called
	them to him, and said to them: <q direct="unspecified">I would not have you disquiet
	  yourselves in regard of me, or apprehend loss to befall you by my
	  death. I have heard what you have said of me and have no doubt
	  that 'twould be as you say, if matters took the course you anticipate;
	  but I am minded that it shall be otherwise. <milestone id="p01010028" />I have committed so
	  many offences against God in the course of my life, that one more in
	  the hour of my death will make no difference whatever to the account.
	  <milestone id="p01010029" />So seek out and bring hither the worthiest and most holy friar you
	  can find, and leave me to settle your affairs and mine upon a sound
	  and solid basis, with which you may rest satisfied.</q> <milestone id="p01010030" />The two brothers
	had not much hope of the result, but yet they went to a friary and
	asked for a holy and discreet man to hear the confession of a Lombard
	that was sick in their house, and returned with an aged man of just
	and holy life, very learned in the Scriptures, and venerable and held
	in very great and especial reverence by all the citizens. <milestone id="p01010031" />As soon as
	he had entered the room where Ser Ciappelletto was lying, and had
	taken his place by his side, he began gently to comfort him: then he
	asked him how long it was since he was confessed. <milestone id="p01010032" />Whereto Ser
	Ciappelletto, who had never been confessed, answered: <q direct="unspecified">Father, it
	  is my constant practice to be confessed at least once a week, and
	  many a week I am confessed more often; but true it is, that, since I
	  have been sick, now eight days, I have made no confession, so sore
	  has been my affliction.</q> <milestone id="p01010033" /><q direct="unspecified">Son,</q> said the friar, <q direct="unspecified">thou hast well
	  done,
	  and well for thee, if so thou continue to do; as thou dost confess
	  so often, I see that my labour of hearkening and questioning will be
	  slight.</q> <milestone id="p01010034" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay but, master friar,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">say not
	  so; I have not confessed so often but that I would fain make a
	  general confession of all my sins that I have committed, so far as
	  I can recall them, from the day of my birth to the present time;
	  and therefore I pray you, my good father, to question me precisely in
	  every particular just as if I had never been confessed. <milestone id="p01010035" />And spare me
	  not by reason of my sickness, for I had far rather do despite to my
	  <pb n="27" />flesh than, sparing it, risk the perdition of my soul, which my Saviour
	  redeemed with His precious blood.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01010036" />The holy man was mightily delighted with these words, which
	seemed to him to betoken a soul in a state of grace. He therefore
	signified to Ser Ciappelletto his high approval of this practice; and
	then began by asking him whether he had ever sinned carnally with
	a woman. <milestone id="p01010037" />Whereto Ser Ciappelletto answered with a sigh: <q direct="unspecified">My
	  father, I scruple to tell you the truth in this matter, fearing lest I sin
	  in vain-glory.</q> <milestone id="p01010038" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay, but,</q> said the friar, <q direct="unspecified">speak boldly; none
	  ever sinned by telling the truth, either in confession or otherwise.</q>
	<milestone id="p01010039" /><q direct="unspecified">Then,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">as you bid me speak boldly, I will
	  tell you the truth of this matter. I am virgin even as when I issued
	  from my mother's womb.</q> <milestone id="p01010040" /><q direct="unspecified">Now God's blessing on thee,</q> said the
	friar, <q direct="unspecified">well done; and the greater is thy merit in that, hadst thou
	  so willed, thou mightest have done otherwise far more readily than
	  we who are under constraint of rule.</q> <milestone id="p01010041" />He then proceeded to ask,
	whether he had offended God by gluttony. Whereto Ser Ciappelletto,
	heaving a heavy sigh, answered that he had frequently so offended;
	for, being wont to fast not only in Lent like other devout persons, but
	at least three days in every week, taking nothing but bread and water,
	he had quaffed the water with as good a gusto and as much enjoyment,
	more particularly when fatigued by devotion or pilgrimage, as great
	drinkers quaff their wine; and oftentimes he had felt a craving for
	such dainty dishes of herbs as ladies make when they go into the
	country, and now and again he had relished his food more than
	seemed to him meet in one who fasted, as he did, for devotion.
	<milestone id="p01010042" /><q direct="unspecified">Son,</q> said the friar, <q direct="unspecified">these sins are natural and very trifling; and
	  therefore I would not have thee burden thy conscience too much
	  with them. There is no man, however holy he may be, but must
	  sometimes find it pleasant to eat after a long fast and to drink after
	  exertion.</q> <milestone id="p01010043" /><q direct="unspecified">O, my father,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">say not this to
	  comfort me. You know well that I know, that the things which are
	  done in the service of God ought to be done in perfect purity of
	  an unsullied spirit; and whoever does otherwise sins.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010044" />The friar,
	well content, replied: <q direct="unspecified">Glad I am that thou dost think so, and I
	  am mightily pleased with thy pure and good conscience which therein
	  appears; but tell me: hast thou sinned by avarice, coveting more
	  than was reasonable, or withholding more than was right?</q> <milestone id="p01010045" /><q direct="unspecified">My
	  <pb n="28" />father,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">I would not have you disquiet
	  yourself, because I am in the house of these usurers: no part have
	  I in their concerns; nay, I did but come here to admonish and
	  reprehend them, and wean them from this abominable traffic; and
	  so, I believe, I had done, had not God sent me this visitation. <milestone id="p01010046" />But
	  you must know, that my father left me a fortune, of which I dedicated
	  the greater part to God; and since then for my own support and the
	  relief of Christ's poor I have done a little trading, whereof I have desired
	  to make gain; and all that I have gotten I have shared with God's
	  poor, reserving one half for my own needs and giving the other half
	  to them; and so well has my Maker prospered me, that I have ever
	  managed my affairs to better and better account.</q> <milestone id="p01010047" /><q direct="unspecified">Well done,</q>
	said the friar; <q direct="unspecified">but how? hast thou often given way to anger?</q>
	<milestone id="p01010048" /><q direct="unspecified">Often indeed, I assure you,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto. <q direct="unspecified">And who
	  could refrain therefrom, seeing men doing frowardly all day long,
	  breaking the commandments of God and recking nought of His
	  judgments? <milestone id="p01010049" />Many a time in the course of a single day I had rather
	  be dead than alive, to see the young men going after vanity, swearing
	  and forswearing themselves, haunting taverns, avoiding the churches,
	  and in short walking in the way of the world rather than in God's
	  way.</q> <milestone id="p01010050" /><q direct="unspecified">My son,</q> said the friar, <q direct="unspecified">this is a righteous wrath; nor
	  could I find occasion therein to lay a penance upon thee. But did
	  anger ever by any chance betray thee into taking human life, or
	  affronting or otherwise wronging any?</q> <milestone id="p01010051" /><q direct="unspecified">Alas,</q> replied Ser
	Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">alas, sir, man of God though you seem to me, how
	  come you to speak after this manner? If I had had so much
	  as the least thought of doing any of the things of which you speak,
	  should I believe, think you, that I had been thus supported or
	  God? These are the deeds of robbers and such like evil men, to
	  whom I have ever said, when any I saw: 'Go, God change your
	  heart.'</q> <milestone id="p01010052" />Said then the friar: <q direct="unspecified">Now, my son, as thou hopest to
	  be blest of God, tell me, hast thou never borne false witness against
	  any, or spoken evil of another, or taken the goods of another without
	  his leave?</q> <milestone id="p01010053" /><q direct="unspecified">Yes, master friar,</q> answered Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">most
	  true it is that I have spoken evil of another; for I had once a neighbour
	  who without the least excuse in the world was ever beating his
	  wife, and so great was my pity of the poor creature, whom, when he
	  was in his cups, he would thrash as God alone knows how, that once I
	  <pb n="29" />spoke evil of him to his wife's kinsfolk.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010054" /><q direct="unspecified">Well, well,</q> said the
	friar, <q direct="unspecified">thou tellest me thou hast been a merchant; hast thou ever
	  cheated any, as merchants use to do?</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010055" /><q direct="unspecified">I'faith, yes, master friar,</q>
	said Ser Ciappelletto; <q direct="unspecified">but I know not who he was; only that he
	  brought me some money which he owed me for some cloth that
	  I had sold him, and I put it in a box without counting it, where
	  a month afterwards I found four farthings more than there should
	  have been, which I kept for a year to return to him, but not seeing
	  him again, I bestowed them in alms for the love of God.</q> <milestone id="p01010056" /><q direct="unspecified">This,</q>
	said the friar, <q direct="unspecified">was a small matter; and thou didst well to bestow
	  them as thou didst.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010057" />The holy friar went on to ask him many
	other questions, to which he made answer in each case in this sort.
	Then, as the friar was about to give him absolution, Ser Ciappelletto
	interposed: <q direct="unspecified">Sir, I have yet a sin to confess.</q> <milestone id="p01010058" /><q direct="unspecified">What?</q> asked the
	friar. <q direct="unspecified">I remember,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">that I once caused my servant to
	  sweep my house on a Saturday after none; and that my observance
	  of Sunday was less devout than it should have been.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010059" /><q direct="unspecified">O, my son,</q>
	said the friar, <q direct="unspecified">this is a light matter.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010060" /><q direct="unspecified">No,</q> said Ser Ciappelletto,
	<q direct="unspecified">say not a light matter; for Sunday is the more to be had in honour
	  because on that day our Lord rose from the dead.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010061" />Then said the
	holy friar: <q direct="unspecified">Now is there aught else that thou hast done?</q>
	<milestone id="p01010062" /><q direct="unspecified">Yes, master friar,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">once by inadvertence
	  I spat in the church of God.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010063" />At this the friar began to smile, and
	said: <q direct="unspecified">My son, this is not a matter to trouble about; we, who are
	  religious, spit there all day long.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010064" /><q direct="unspecified">And great impiety it is when
	  you so do,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">for there is nothing that
	  is so worthy to be kept from all impurity as the holy temple in which
	  sacrifice is offered to God.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010065" />More he said in the same strain, which I
	pass over; and then at last he began to sigh, and by and by to weep
	bitterly, as he was well able to do when he chose. 
	<milestone id="p01010066" />And the friar demanding: 
	<q direct="unspecified">My son, why weepest thou?</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010067" /><q direct="unspecified">Alas, master friar,</q> 
	answered Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">a sin yet remains, which I have
	  never confessed, such shame were it to me to tell it; and as often as
	  I call it to mind, I weep as you now see me weep, being well assured
	  that God will never forgive me this sin.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010068" />Then said the holy friar:
	<q direct="unspecified">Come, come, son, what is this that thou sayst? If all the sins of
	  all the men, that ever were or ever shall be, as long as the world shall
	  endure, were concentrated in one man, so great is the goodness of
	  <pb n="30" />God that He would freely pardon them all, were he but penitent and
	  contrite as I see thou art, and confessed them: wherefore tell me thy
	  sin with a good courage.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010069" />Then said Ser Ciappelletto, still weeping
	bitterly: <q direct="unspecified">Alas, my father, mine is too great a sin, and scarce can
	  I believe, if your prayers do not co-operate, that God will ever grant
	  me His pardon thereof.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010070" /><q direct="unspecified">Tell it with a good courage,</q> said the
	friar; <q direct="unspecified">I promise thee to pray God for thee.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010071" />Ser Ciappelletto,
	however, continued to weep, and would not speak, for all the friar's
	encouragement. When he had kept him for a good while in suspense,
	he heaved a mighty sigh, and said: <q direct="unspecified">My father, as you promise me
	  to pray God for me, I will tell it you. Know, then, that once, when I
	  was a little child, I cursed my mother;</q> and having so said he began
	again to weep bitterly. 
	<milestone id="p01010072" /><q direct="unspecified">O, my son,</q> said the friar, <q direct="unspecified">does this seem
	  to thee so great a sin? Men curse God all day long, and He pardons
	  them freely, if they repent them of having so done; and thinkest
	  thou He will not pardon thee this? Weep not, be comforted, for
	  truly, hadst thou been one of them that set Him on the Cross, with
	  the contrition that I see in thee, thou wouldst not fail of His pardon.</q>
	<milestone id="p01010073" /><q direct="unspecified">Alas! my father,</q> rejoined Ser Ciappelletto, <q direct="unspecified">what is this you
	  say? To curse my sweet mother that carried me in her womb
	  for nine months day and night, and afterwards on her shoulder
	  more than a hundred times! Heinous indeed was my offence;
	  'tis too great a sin; nor will it be pardoned, unless you pray God
	  for me.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01010074" />The friar now perceiving that Ser Ciappelletto had nothing more
	to say, gave him absolution and his blessing, reputing him for a most
	holy man, fully believing that all that he had said was true. And
	who would not have so believed, hearing him so speak at the point
	of death? 
	<milestone id="p01010075" />Then, when all was done, he said: <q direct="unspecified">Ser Ciappelletto,
	  if God so will, you will soon be well; but should it so come to pass
	  that God call your blessed soul to Himself in this state of grace, is
	  it well pleasing to you that your body be buried in our convent?</q>
	<milestone id="p01010076" /><q direct="unspecified">Yea, verily, master friar,</q> replied Ser Ciappelletto; <q direct="unspecified">there would
	  I be, and nowhere else, since you have promised to pray God for
	  me; besides which I have ever had a special devotion to your order.
	  Wherefore I pray you, that, on your return to your convent, you
	  cause to be sent me that very Body of Christ, which you consecrate
	  in the morning on the altar; because (unworthy though I be) I
	  <pb n="31" />purpose with your leave to take it, and afterwards the holy and
	  extreme unction, that, though I have lived as a sinner, I may die
	  at any rate as a Christian.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010077" />The holy man said that he was greatly
	delighted, that it was well said of Ser Ciappelletto, and that
	he would cause the Host to be forthwith brought to him; and
	so it was.</p><p><milestone id="p01010078" />The two brothers, who much misdoubted Ser Ciappelletto's power
	to deceive the friar, had taken their stand on the other side of a
	wooden partition which divided the room in which Ser Ciappelletto
	lay from another, and hearkening there they readily heard and understood
	what Ser Ciappelletto said to the friar; and at times could
	scarce refrain their laughter as they followed his confession; and
	now and again they said one to another: 
	<milestone id="p01010079" /><q direct="unspecified">What manner of man
	  is this, whom neither age nor sickness, nor fear of death, on the
	  threshold of which he now stands, nor yet of God, before whose
	  judgment-seat he must soon appear, has been able to turn from his
	  wicked ways, that he die not even as he has lived?</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010080" />But seeing that
	his confession had secured the interment of his body in church, they
	troubled themselves no further. 
	<milestone id="p01010081" />Ser Ciappelletto soon afterwards
	communicated, and growing immensely worse, received the extreme
	unction, and died shortly after vespers on the same day on which he
	had made his good confession. 
	<milestone id="p01010082" />So the two brothers, having from
	his own moneys provided the wherewith to procure him honourable
	sepulture, and sent word to the friars to come at even to observe the
	usual vigil, and in the morning to fetch the corpse, set all things
	in order accordingly. 
	<milestone id="p01010083" />The holy friar who had confessed him, hearing
	that he was dead, had audience of the prior of the friary; a chapter
	was convened and the assembled brothers heard from the confessor's
	own mouth how Ser Ciappelletto had been a holy man, as had
	appeared by his confession, and were exhorted to receive the body
	with the utmost veneration and pious care, as one by which there
	was good hope that God would work many miracles. 
	<milestone id="p01010084" />To this the
	prior and the rest of the credulous confraternity assenting, they went
	in a body in the evening to the place where the corpse of Ser
	Ciappelletto lay, and kept a great and solemn vigil over it; and in
	the morning they made a procession habited in their surplices and
	copes, with books in their hands and crosses in front; and chanting
	as they went, they fetched the corpse and brought it back to their
	<pb n="32" />church with the utmost pomp and solemnity, being followed by
	almost all the folk of the city, men and women alike. 
	<milestone id="p01010085" />So it was laid
	in the church, and then the holy friar who had heard the confession
	got up in the pulpit and began to preach marvellous things of Ser
	Ciappelletto's life, his fasts, his virginity, his simplicity and
	guilelessness and holiness; narrating among other matters that of which
	Ser Ciappelletto had made tearful confession as his greatest sin, and
	how he had hardly been able to make him conceive that God would
	pardon him; from which he took occasion to reprove his hearers;
	saying: <q direct="unspecified">And you, accursed of God, on the least pretext, blaspheme
	  God and His Mother, and all the celestial court.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01010086" />And much
	beside he told of his loyalty and purity; and, in short, so wrought
	upon the people by his words, to which they gave entire credence,
	that they all conceived a great veneration for Ser Ciappelletto, and
	at the close of the office came pressing forward with the utmost
	vehemence to kiss the feet and the hands of the corpse, from which
	they tore off the cerements, each thinking himself blessed to have
	but a scrap thereof in his possession; and so it was arranged that
	it should be kept there all day long, so as to be visible and accessible
	to all. 
	<milestone id="p01010087" />At nightfall it was honourably interred in a marble tomb
	in one of the chapels, where on the morrow, one by one, folk came
	and lit tapers and prayed and paid their vows, setting there the
	waxen images which they had dedicated. <milestone id="p01010088" />And the fame of Ciappelletto's
	holiness and the devotion to him grew in such measure that
	scarce any there was that in any adversity would vow aught to any
	saint but he, and they called him and still call him San Ciappelletto,
	affirming that many miracles have been and daily are wrought by
	God through him for such as devoutly crave his intercession.</p><div3 who="panfilo" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01010089" />So lived, so died Ser Cepperello da Prato, and came to be reputed
	a saint, as you have heard. Nor would I deny that it is possible that
	he is of the number of the blessed in the presence of God, seeing
	that, though his life was evil and depraved, yet he might in his last
	moments have made so complete an act of contrition that perchance
	God had mercy on him and received him into His kingdom. But,
	as this is hidden from us, I speak according to that which appears,
	and I say that he ought rather to be in the hands of the devil in hell
	than in Paradise. <milestone id="p01010090" />Which, if so it be, is a manifest token of the
	superabundance of the goodness of God to usward, inasmuch as He
	<pb n="33" />regards not our error but the sincerity of our faith, and hearkens
	unto us when, mistaking one who is at enmity with Him for a
	friend, we have recourse to him, as to one holy indeed, as our intercessor
	for His grace. <milestone id="p01010091" />Wherefore, that we of this gay company
	may by His grace be preserved safe and sound throughout this time
	of adversity, commend we ourselves in our need to Him, whose
	name we began by invoking, with lauds and reverent devotion and
	good confidence that we shall be heard.</p></div3><div3 who="author" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01010092" />And so he was silent.</p></div3></div2><pb n="34" /><div2 type="novella" who="neifile" id="nov0102"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01020001" />Abraham, a Jew, at the instance of Jehannot de
 Chevigny, goes to the court of Rome, and having
 marked the evil life of the clergy, returns to Paris,
 and becomes a Christian.</p></argument><div3 who="author" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01020002" />Pamfilo's story elicited the mirth of some of the ladies and the
	hearty commendation of all, who listened to it with close attention
	until the end. Whereupon the queen bade Neifile, who sat next
	her, to tell a story, that the commencement thus made of their
	diversions might have its sequel. Neifile, whose graces of mind
	matched the beauty of her person, consented with a gladsome goodwill,
	and thus began:</p></div3><div3 who="neifile" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01020003" />Pamfilo has shewn by his story that the goodness of God spares
 to regard our errors when they result from unavoidable ignorance;
 and in mine I mean to shew you how the same goodness, bearing
 patiently with the shortcomings of those who should be its faithful
 witness in deed and word, draws from them contrariwise evidence
 of His infallible truth; to the end that what we believe we may
 with more assured conviction follow.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01020004" />In Paris, gracious ladies, as I have heard tell, there was once
 a great merchant, a large dealer in drapery, a good man, most loyal
 and righteous, his name Jehannot de Chevigny, between whom and
 a Jew, Abraham by name, also a merchant, and a man of great
 wealth, as also most loyal and righteous, there subsisted a very close
 friendship. <milestone id="p01020005" />Now Jehannot, observing Abraham's loyalty and rectitude,
 began to be sorely vexed in spirit that the soul of one so
 worthy and wise and good should perish for want of faith. 
<milestone id="p01020006" />Wherefore
 he began in a friendly manner to plead with him, that he should
 <pb n="35" />leave the errors of the Jewish faith and turn to the Christian verity,
 which, being sound and holy, he might see daily prospering and
 gaining ground, whereas, on the contrary, his own religion was
 dwindling and was almost come to nothing. <milestone id="p01020007" />The Jew replied that
 he believed that there was no faith sound and holy except the Jewish
 faith, in which he was born, and in which he meant to live and die;
 nor would anything ever turn him therefrom. <milestone id="p01020008" />Nothing daunted,
 however, Jehannot some days afterwards began again to ply Abraham
 with similar arguments, explaining to him in such crude fashion as
 merchants use the reasons why our faith is better than the Jewish.
 <milestone id="p01020009" />And though the Jew was a great master in the Jewish law, yet,
 whether it was by reason of his friendship for Jehannot, or that the
 Holy Spirit dictated the words that the simple merchant used, at any
 rate the Jew began to be much interested in Jehannot's arguments,
 though still too staunch in his faith to suffer himself to be converted.
 <milestone id="p01020010" />But Jehannot was no less assiduous in plying him with argument
 than he was obstinate in adhering to his law, insomuch that at length
 the Jew, overcome by such incessant appeals, said: <q direct="unspecified">Well, well,
 Jehannot, thou wouldst have me become a Christian, and I am
 disposed to do so, provided I first go to Rome and there see him
 whom thou callest God's vicar on earth, and observe what manner
 of life he leads and his brother cardinals with him; <milestone id="p01020011" />and if such it
 be that thereby, in conjunction with thy words, I may understand
 that thy faith is better than mine, as thou hast sought to shew me,
 I will do as I have said: otherwise, I will remain as I am a Jew.</q>
 <milestone id="p01020012" />When Jehannot heard this, he was greatly distressed, saying to himself:
 <q direct="unspecified">I thought to have converted him; but now I see that the
 pains which I took for so excellent a purpose are all in vain; for, if he
 goes to the court of Rome and sees the iniquitous and foul life which
 the clergy lead there, so far from turning Christian, had he been
 converted already, he would without doubt relapse into Judaism.</q>
 <milestone id="p01020013" />Then turning to Abraham he said: <q direct="unspecified">Nay, but, my friend, why
 wouldst thou be at all this labour and great expense of travelling
 from here to Rome? to say nothing of the risks both by sea and by
 land which a rich man like thee must needs run. <milestone id="p01020014" />Thinkest thou
 not to find here one that can give thee baptism? And as for any
 doubts that thou mayst have touching the faith to which I point thee,
 where wilt thou find greater masters and sages therein than here, to
 <pb n="36" />resolve thee of any question thou mayst put to them? <milestone id="p01020015" />Wherefore
 in my opinion this journey of thine is superfluous. Think that the
 prelates there are such as thou mayst have seen here, nay, as much
 better as they are nearer to the Chief Pastor. And so, by my advice
 thou wilt spare thy pains until some time of indulgence, when I,
 perhaps, may be able to bear thee company.</q> <milestone id="p01020016" />The Jew replied:
 <q direct="unspecified">Jehannot, I doubt not that so it is as thou sayst; but once and
 for all I tell thee that I am minded to go there, and will never otherwise
 do that which thou wouldst have me and hast so earnestly
 besought me to do.</q> <milestone id="p01020017" /><q direct="unspecified">Go then,</q> said Jehannot, seeing that his
 mind was made up, <q direct="unspecified">and good luck go with thee;</q> and so he gave
 up the contest because nothing would be lost, though he felt sure
 that he would never become a Christian after seeing the court of
 Rome. <milestone id="p01020018" />The Jew took horse, and posted with all possible speed
 to Rome; where on his arrival he was honourably received by his
 fellow Jews. <milestone id="p01020019" />He said nothing to any one of the purpose for which
 he had come; but began circumspectly to acquaint himself with the
 ways of the Pope and the cardinals and the other prelates and all the
 courtiers; and from what he saw for himself, being a man of great
 intelligence, or learned from others, he discovered that without
 distinction of rank they were all sunk in the most disgraceful lewdness,
 sinning not only in the way of nature but after the manner
 of the men of Sodom, without any restraint of remorse or shame, in
 such sort that, when any great favour was to be procured, the influence
 of the courtesans and boys was of no small moment. <milestone id="p01020020" />Moreover he
 found them one and all gluttonous, wine-bibbers, drunkards, and next
 after lewdness, most addicted to the shameless service of the belly,
 like brute beasts. <milestone id="p01020021" />And, as he probed the matter still further, he
 perceived that they were all so greedy and avaricious that human, nay
 Christian blood, and things sacred of what kind soever, spiritualities
 no less than temporalities, they bought and sold for money; which
 traffic was greater and employed more brokers than the drapery trade
 and all the other trades of Paris put together; open simony and
 gluttonous excess being glosed under such specious terms as
 <q direct="unspecified">arrangement</q>
 and <q direct="unspecified">moderate use of creature comforts,</q> as if God could not
 penetrate the thoughts of even the most corrupt hearts, to say nothing
 of the signification of words, and would suffer Himself to be misled
 after the manner of men by the names of things. <milestone id="p01020022" />Which matters,
 <pb n="37" />with many others which are not to be mentioned, our modest and
 sober-minded Jew found by no means to his liking, so that, his
 curiosity being fully satisfied, he was minded to return to Paris; which
 accordingly he did. <milestone id="p01020023" />There, on his arrival, he was met by Jehannot;
 and the two made great cheer together. Jehannot expected Abraham's
 conversion least of all things, and allowed him some days of rest before
 he asked what he thought of the Holy Father and the cardinals and
 the other courtiers. <milestone id="p01020024" />To which the Jew forthwith replied: <q direct="unspecified">I think
 God owes them all an evil recompense: I tell thee, so far as I was
 able to carry my investigations, holiness, devotion, good works or
 exemplary living in any kind was nowhere to be found in any clerk;
 but only lewdness, avarice, gluttony, and the like, and worse, if worse
 may be, appeared to be held in such honour of all, that (to my thinking)
 the place is a centre of diabolical rather than of divine activities.
 <milestone id="p01020025" />To the best of my judgment, your Pastor, and by consequence all
 that are about him devote all their zeal and ingenuity and subtlety
 to devise how best and most speedily they may bring the Christian
 religion to nought and banish it from the world. <milestone id="p01020026" />And because I see
 that what they so zealously endeavour does not come to pass, but
 that on the contrary your religion continually grows, and shines
 more and more clear, therein I seem to discern a very evident token
 that it, rather than any other, as being more true and holy than any
 other, has the Holy Spirit for its foundation and support. <milestone id="p01020027" />For which
 cause, whereas I met your exhortations in a harsh and obdurate
 temper, and would not become a Christian, now I frankly tell you
 that I would on no account omit to become such. Go we then to
 the church, and there according to the traditional rite of your holy
 faith let me receive baptism.</q> <milestone id="p01020028" />Jehannot, who had anticipated a
 diametrically opposite conclusion, as soon as he heard him so speak,
 was the best pleased man that ever was in the world. So taking
 Abraham with him to Notre Dame he prayed the clergy there to
 baptise him. <milestone id="p01020029" />When they heard that it was his own wish, they forthwith
 did so, and Jehannot raised him from the sacred font, and named
 him Jean; and afterwards he caused teachers of great eminence
 thoroughly to instruct him in our faith, which he readily learned,
 and afterwards practised in a good, a virtuous, nay, a holy life.</p></div2><pb n="38" /><div2 type="novella" who="filomena" id="nov0103"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01030001" />Melchisedech, a Jew, by a story of three rings averts a

      <milestone id="p01030004" />Well ye know, or should know, loving gossips, that, as it often
      happens that folk by their own folly forfeit a happy estate and are
      plunged in most grievous misery, so good sense will extricate the wise
      from extremity of peril, and establish them in complete and assured

      within the narrow compass of a little story.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01030006" />Saladin, who by his great valour had from small beginnings made
      himself Soldan of Egypt, and gained many victories over kings both
      Christian and Saracen, having in divers wars and by divers lavish
      displays of magnificence spent all his treasure, and in order to meet
      a certain emergency being in need of a large sum of money, and
      being at a loss to raise it with a celerity adequate to his necessity,
      <pb n="39" />bethought him of a wealthy Jew, Melchisedech by name, who lent
      at usance in Alexandria, <milestone id="p01030007" />and who, were he but willing, was, as he
      believed, able to accommodate him, but was so miserly that he would
      never do so of his own accord, nor was Saladin disposed to constrain him
      thereto. So great, however, was his necessity that, after pondering
      every method whereby the Jew might be induced to be compliant, at
      last he determined to devise a colourably reasonable pretext for extorting
      the money from him. <milestone id="p01030008" />So he sent for him, received him affably,
      seated him by his side, and presently said to him: <q direct="unspecified">My good man, I
	have heard from many people that thou art very wise, and of great
	discernment in divine things; wherefore I would gladly know of thee,
	which of the three laws thou reputest the true law, the law of the
	Jews, the law of the Saracens, or the law of the Christians?</q> 
      <milestone id="p01030009" />The Jew,
      who was indeed a wise man, saw plainly enough that Saladin meant
      to entangle him in his speech, that he might have occasion to harass
      him, and bethought him that he could not praise any of the three laws
      above another without furnishing Saladin with the pretext which he
      sought. So, concentrating all the force of his mind to shape such an
      answer as might avoid the snare, he presently lit on what he sought,
      saying: 
      <milestone id="p01030010" /><q direct="unspecified">My lord, a pretty question indeed is this which you propound,
	and fain would I answer it; to which end it is apposite that
	I tell you a story, which, if you will hearken, is as follows: 
	<milestone id="p01030011" />If I
	mistake not, I remember to have often heard tell of a great and rich
	man of old time, who among other most precious jewels had in his
	treasury a ring of extraordinary beauty and value, which by reason
	of its value and beauty he was minded to leave to his heirs for ever;
	for which cause he ordained, that, whichever of his sons was found
	in possession of the ring as by his bequest, should thereby be designate
	his heir, and be entitled to receive from the rest the honour and
	homage due to a superior. <milestone id="p01030012" />The son, to whom he bequeathed the
	ring, left it in like manner to his descendants, making the like
	ordinance as his predecessor. In short the ring passed from hand to
	hand for many generations; and in the end came to the hands of
	one who had three sons, goodly and virtuous all, and very obedient
	to their father, so that he loved them all indifferently. <milestone id="p01030013" />The rule
	touching the descent of the ring was known to the young men, and
	each aspiring to hold the place of honour among them did all he
	could to persuade his father, who was now old, to leave the ring to
	<pb n="40" />him at his death. <milestone id="p01030014" />The worthy man, who loved them all equally, and
	knew not how to choose from among them a sole legatee, promised
	the ring to each in turn, and in order to satisfy all three, caused a
	cunning artificer secretly to make other two rings, so like the first,
	that the maker himself could hardly tell which was the true ring.
	So, before he died, he disposed of the rings, giving one privily to
	each of his sons; <milestone id="p01030015" />whereby it came to pass, that after his decease each
	of the sons claimed the inheritance and the place of honour, and, his
	claim being disputed by his brothers, produced his ring in witness of
	right. And the rings being found so like one to another that it
	was impossible to distinguish the true one, the suit to determine the
	true heir remained pendent, and still so remains. <milestone id="p01030016" />And so, my lord,
	to your question, touching the three laws given to the three peoples
	by God the Father, I answer: Each of these peoples deems itself to
	have the true inheritance, the true law, the true commandments of
	God; but which of them is justified in so believing, is a question
	which, like that of the rings, remains pendent.</q> 
      <milestone id="p01030017" />The excellent
      adroitness with which the Jew had contrived to evade the snare
      which he had laid for his feet was not lost upon Saladin. He therefore
      determined to let the Jew know his need, and did so, telling him
      at the same time what he had intended to do, in the event of his
      answering less circumspectly than he had done.</p><p><milestone id="p01030018" />Thereupon the Jew gave the Soldan all the accommodation that
      he required, which the Soldan afterwards repaid him in full. He
      also gave him most munificent gifts with his lifelong amity and a
      great and honourable position near his person.</p></div2><pb n="41" /><div2 type="novella" who="dioneo" id="nov0104"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01040001" />A monk lapses into a sin meriting the most severe punishment,

 Seeing, then, that we have heard how Abraham saved his soul by the
 good counsel of Jehannot de Chevigny, and Melchisedech by his own
 good sense safe-guarded his wealth against the stratagems of Saladin,
 I hope to escape your censure in narrating a brief story of a monk,
 who by his address delivered his body from imminent peril of most
 severe chastisement.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01040004" />In the not very remote district of Lunigiana there flourished
 formerly a community of monks more numerous and holy than is
 there to be found to-day, among whom was a young brother, whose
 vigour and lustihood neither the fasts nor the vigils availed to subdue.
<milestone id="p01040005" /> One afternoon, while the rest of the confraternity slept, our young
 monk took a stroll around the church, which lay in a very sequestered
 spot, and chanced to espy a young and very beautiful girl, a
 daughter, perhaps, of one of the husbandmen of those parts, going
 through the fields and gathering herbs as she went. No sooner had
 <pb n="42" />he seen her than he was sharply assailed by carnal concupiscence,
 <milestone id="p01040006" />insomuch that he made up to and accosted her; and (she hearkening)
 little by little they came to an understanding, and unobserved
 by any entered his cell together. <milestone id="p01040007" />Now it so chanced that, while
 they fooled it within somewhat recklessly, he being overwrought
 with passion, the abbot awoke and passing slowly by the young
 monk's cell, heard the noise which they made within, and the better
 to distinguish the voices, came softly up to the door of the cell, and
 listening discovered that beyond all doubt there was a woman within.
 His first thought was to force the door open; but, changing his
 mind, he returned to his chamber and waited until the monk should
 come out.</p><p><milestone id="p01040008" />Delightsome beyond measure though the monk found his
 intercourse with the girl, yet was he not altogether without anxiety.
 He had heard, as he thought, the sound of footsteps in the dormitory,
 and having applied his eye to a convenient aperture had had a good
 view of the abbot as he stood by the door listening. He was thus
 fully aware that the abbot might have detected the presence of a
 woman in the cell. <milestone id="p01040009" />Whereat he was exceedingly distressed, knowing
 that he had a severe punishment to expect; but he concealed his
 vexation from the girl while he busily cast about in his mind for
 some way of escape from his embarrassment. <milestone id="p01040010" />He thus hit on a novel
 stratagem which was exactly suited to his purpose. With the air of
 one who had had enough of the girl's company he said to her: <q direct="unspecified">I
 shall now leave you in order that I may arrange for your departure
 hence unobserved. Stay here quietly until I return.</q> 
<milestone id="p01040011" />So out he
 went, locking the door of the cell, and withdrawing the key, which
 he carried straight to the abbot's chamber and handed to him, as was
 the custom when a monk was going out, saying with a composed air:
 <q direct="unspecified">Sir, I was not able this morning to bring in all the faggots which I
 had made ready, so with your leave I will go to the wood and bring
 them in.</q> 
<milestone id="p01040012" />The abbot, desiring to have better cognisance of the
 monk's offence, and not dreaming that the monk knew that he had
 been detected, was pleased with the turn matters had taken, and
 received the key gladly, at the same time giving the monk the desired
 leave. 
<milestone id="p01040013" />So the monk withdrew, and the abbot began to consider what
 course it were best for him to take, whether to assemble the brotherhood
 and open the door in their presence, that, being witnesses of
 <pb n="43" />the delinquency, they might have no cause to murmur against him
 when he proceeded to punish the delinquent, or whether it were not
 better first to learn from the girl's own lips how it had come about.
 <milestone id="p01040014" />And reflecting that she might be the wife or daughter of some man
 who would take it ill that she should be shamed by being exposed to
 the gaze of all the monks, he determined first of all to find out who
 she was, and then to make up his mind. So he went softly to the
 cell, opened the door, and, having entered, closed it behind him.
 The girl, seeing that her visitor was none other than the abbot, quite
 lost her presence of mind, and quaking with shame began to weep.
 <milestone id="p01040015" />Master abbot surveyed her from head to foot, and seeing that she
 was fresh and comely, fell a prey, old though he was, to fleshly
 cravings no less poignant and sudden than those which the young
 monk had experienced, and began thus to commune with himself:
 <q direct="unspecified">Alas! why take I not my pleasure when I may, seeing that I
 never need lack for occasions of trouble and vexation of spirit? Here
 is a fair wench, and no one in the world to know. If I can bring her
 to pleasure me, I know not why I should not do so. 
<milestone id="p01040016" />Who will
 know? No one will ever know; and sin that is hidden is half
 forgiven; this chance may never come again; so, methinks, it were
 the part of wisdom to take the boon which God bestows.</q> 
<milestone id="p01040017" />So
 musing, with an altogether different purpose from that with which
 he had come, he drew near the girl, and softly bade her to be
 comforted, and besought her not to weep; and so little by little he
 came at last to show her what he would be at. <milestone id="p01040018" />The girl, being
 made neither of iron nor of adamant, was readily induced to gratify
 the abbot, who after bestowing upon her many an embrace and
 kiss, got upon the monk's bed, where, being sensible, perhaps, of the
 disparity between his reverend portliness and her tender youth, and
 fearing to injure her by his excessive weight, he refrained from lying
 upon her, but laid her upon him, and in that manner disported
 himself with her for a long time. 
<milestone id="p01040019" />The monk, who had only pretended
 to go to the wood, and had concealed himself in the dormitory,
 no sooner saw the abbot enter his cell than he was overjoyed to
 think that his plan would succeed; and when he saw that he had
 locked the door, he was well assured thereof. So he stole out of his
 hiding-place, and set his eye to an aperture through which he saw
 and heard all that the abbot did and said. 
<milestone id="p01040020" />At length the abbot,
 <pb n="44" />having had enough of dalliance with the girl, locked her in the cell
 and returned to his chamber. Catching sight of the monk soon
 afterwards, and supposing him to have returned from the wood,
 he determined to give him a sharp reprimand and have him
 imprisoned, that he might thus secure the prey for himself alone.
 He therefore caused him to be summoned, chid him very severely and
 with a stern countenance, and ordered him to be put in prison. 
<milestone id="p01040021" />The
 monk replied trippingly: <q direct="unspecified">Sir, I have not been so long in the order
 of St. Benedict as to have every particular of the rule by heart; nor
 did you teach me before to-day in what posture it behoves the monk
 to have intercourse with women, but limited your instruction to such
 matters as fasts and vigils. As, however, you have now given me
 my lesson, I promise you, if you also pardon my offence, that I will
 never repeat it, but will always follow the example which you have
 set me.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01040022" />The abbot, who was a shrewd man, saw at once that the monk
 was not only more knowing than he, but had actually seen what he
 had done; nor, conscience-stricken himself, could he for shame mete
 out to the monk a measure which he himself merited. So pardon
 given, with an injunction to bury what had been seen in silence,
 they decently conveyed the young girl out of the monastery, whither,
 it is to be believed, they now and again caused her to return.</p></div2><pb n="45" /><div2 type="novella" who="fiammetta" id="nov0105"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01050001" />The Marchioness of Monferrato by a banquet of hens

      was gone overseas as gonfalonier of the Church in a general array of
      the Christian forces. 
      <milestone id="p01050006" />Whose merits being canvassed at the court of
      Philippe le Borgne, on the eve of his departure from France on the
      same service, a knight observed, that there was not under the stars
      <pb n="46" />a couple comparable to the Marquis and his lady; in that, while the
      Marquis was a paragon of the knightly virtues, his lady for beauty
      and honour was without a peer among all the other ladies of the
      world. <milestone id="p01050007" />These words made so deep an impression on the mind of
      the King of France that, though he had never seen the lady, he fell
      ardently in love with her, and, being to join the armada, resolved that
      his port of embarcation should be no other than Genoa, in order that,
      travelling thither by land, he might find a decent pretext for visiting
      the Marchioness, with whom in the absence of the Marquis he
      trusted to have the success which he desired; <milestone id="p01050008" />nor did he fail to put
      his design in execution. Having sent his main army on before, he
      took the road himself with a small company of gentlemen, and, as
      they approached the territory of the Marquis, he despatched a courier
      to the Marchioness, a day in advance, to let her know that he
      expected to breakfast with her the next morning. <milestone id="p01050009" />The lady, who
      knew her part and played it well, replied graciously, that he would
      be indeed welcome, and that his presence would be the greatest of
      all favours. She then began to commune with herself, what this
      might import, that so great a king should come to visit her in her
      husband's absence, nor was she so deluded as not to surmise that it
      was the fame of her beauty that drew him thither. <milestone id="p01050010" />Nevertheless she
      made ready to do him honour in a manner befitting her high degree,
      summoning to her presence such of the retainers as remained in the
      castle, and giving all needful directions with their advice, except that
      the order of the banquet and the choice of the dishes she reserved
      entirely to herself. Then, having caused all the hens that could be
      found in the country-side to be brought with all speed into the castle,
      she bade her cooks furnish forth the royal table with divers dishes
      made exclusively of such fare. <milestone id="p01050011" />The King arrived on the appointed
      day, and was received by the lady with great and ceremonious cheer.
      Fair and noble and gracious seemed she in the eyes of the King
      beyond all that he had conceived from the knight's words, so that he
      was lost in admiration and inly extolled her to the skies, his passion
      being the more inflamed in proportion as he found the lady surpass
      the idea which he had formed of her. <milestone id="p01050012" />A suite of rooms furnished
      with all the appointments befitting the reception of so great a king,
      was placed at his disposal, and after a little rest, breakfast-time being
      come, he and the Marchioness took their places at the same table,
      <pb n="47" />while his suite were honourably entertained at other boards according
      to their several qualities. <milestone id="p01050013" />Many courses were served with no lack
      of excellent and rare wines, whereby the King was mightily pleased,
      as also by the extraordinary beauty of the Marchioness, on whom his
      eye from time to time rested. However, as course followed course,
      the King observed with some surprise, that, though the dishes were
      diverse, yet they were all but variations of one and the same fare, to
      wit, the pullet. <milestone id="p01050014" />Besides which he knew that the domain was one
      which could not but afford plenty of divers sorts of game, and by
      forewarning the lady of his approach, he had allowed time for hunting;
      yet, for all his surprise, he would not broach the question more
      directly with her than by a reference to her hens; so, turning to her
      with a smile, he said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, do hens grow in this country
	without so much as a single cock?</q> 
      <milestone id="p01050015" />The Marchioness, who perfectly
      apprehended the drift of the question, saw in it an opportunity,
      sent her by God, of evincing her virtuous resolution; so casting a
      haughty glance upon the King she answered thus: <q direct="unspecified">Sire, no; but
	the women, though they may differ somewhat from others in dress
	and rank, are yet of the same nature here as elsewhere.</q> 
      <milestone id="p01050016" />The 
      significance of the banquet of pullets was made manifest to the King
      by these words, as also the virtue which they veiled. He perceived
      that on a lady of such a temper words would be wasted, and that
      force was out of the question. Wherefore, yielding to the dictates
      of prudence and honour, he was now as prompt to quench, as he
      had been inconsiderate in conceiving, his unfortunate passion for the
      lady; 
      <milestone id="p01050017" />and fearing her answers, he refrained from further jesting with
      her, and dismissing his hopes devoted himself to his breakfast, which
      done, he disarmed suspicion of the dishonourable purpose of his visit
      by an early departure, and thanking her for the honour she had
      conferred upon him, and commending her to God, took the road to
      Genoa.</p></div2><pb n="48" /><div2 type="novella" who="emilia" id="nov0106"><head>Novel VI</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01060001" />A worthy man by an apt saying puts to shame the wicked

 with a good courage thus began:</p></div3><div3 who="fiammetta" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01060003" />My story is also of a reproof, but of one administered by a
 worthy man, who lived the secular life, to a greedy religious, by
      a jibe as merry as admirable.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01060004" />Know then, dear ladies, that there
 was in our city, not long ago, a friar minor, an inquisitor in
 matters of heresy, who, albeit he strove might and main to pass
 himself off as a holy man and tenderly solicitous for the integrity
 of the Christian Faith, as they all do, yet he had as keen a
 scent for a full purse as for a deficiency of faith. <milestone id="p01060005" />Now it so
 chanced that his zeal was rewarded by the discovery of a good man
 far better furnished with money than with sense, who in an unguarded
 moment, not from defect of faith, but rather, perhaps, from
 excess of hilarity, being heated with wine, had happened to say to
 his boon companions, that he had a wine good enough for Christ
 Himself to drink. <milestone id="p01060006" />Which being reported to the inquisitor, he,
 knowing the man to be possessed of large estates and a well-lined
 purse, set to work in hot haste, <q direct="unspecified">cum gladiis et fustibus,</q> to bring
 all the rigour of the law to bear upon him, designing thereby not to
 lighten the load of his victim's misbelief, but to increase the weight of
 his own purse by the florins, which he might, as he did, receive from
 him. <milestone id="p01060007" />So he cited him to his presence, and asked him whether what
 was alleged against him were true. The good man answered in the
 affirmative, and told him how it had happened. 
<milestone id="p01060008" /><q direct="unspecified">Then,</q> said our
 <pb n="49" />most holy and devout inquisitor of St. John Goldenbeard,<note>The
 fiorino

 thou made Christ a wine-bibber, and a lover of rare vintages, as if
 He were a sot, a toper and a tavern-haunter even as one of you. And
 thinkest thou now by a few words of apology to pass this off as a
 light matter? It is no such thing as thou supposest. Thou hast
 deserved the fire; and we should but do our duty, did we inflict it
 upon thee.</q> 
<milestone id="p01060009" />With these and the like words in plenty he upbraided
 him, bending on him meanwhile a countenance as stern as if
 Epicurus had stood before him denying the immortality of the soul.
 In short he so terrified him that the good man was fain to employ
 certain intermediaries to anoint his palms with a liberal allowance of
 St. John Goldenmouth's grease, an excellent remedy for the disease of
 avarice which spreads like a pestilence among the clergy, and notably
 among the friars minors, who dare not touch a coin, that he might
 deal gently with him. <milestone id="p01060010" />And great being the virtue of this ointment,
 albeit no mention is made thereof by Galen in any part of his
 Medicines, it had so gracious an effect that the threatened fire gave
 place to a cross, which he was to wear as if he were bound for the
 emprise over seas; and to make the ensign more handsome the
 inquisitor ordered that it should be yellow upon a black ground.
 <milestone id="p01060011" />Besides which, after pocketing the coin, he kept him dangling about
 him for some days, bidding him by way of penance hear mass every
 morning at Santa Croce, and afterwards wait upon him at the
 breakfast-hour, after which he was free to do as he pleased for the
 rest of the day. 
<milestone id="p01060012" />All which he most carefully observed; and so it
 fell out that one of these mornings there were chanted at the mass
 at which he assisted the following words of the Gospel: You shall
 receive an hundredfold and shall possess eternal life. With these
 words deeply graven in his memory, he presented himself, as he was
 bidden, before the inquisitor, where he sate taking his breakfast, and
 being asked whether he had heard mass that morning, 
<milestone id="p01060013" />he promptly answered: <q direct="unspecified">Yes, sir.</q> 
<milestone id="p01060014" />And being further asked: <q direct="unspecified">Heardest
 thou aught therein, as to which thou art in doubt, or hast thou any
 question to propound?</q> 
<milestone id="p01060015" />the good man responded: <q direct="unspecified">Nay indeed,
 doubt have I none of aught that I heard; but rather assured faith in
 the verity of all. One thing, however, I heard, which caused me to
 <pb n="50" />commiserate you and the rest of you friars very heartily, in regard
 of the evil plight in which you must find yourselves in the other
 world.</q> 
<milestone id="p01060016" /><q direct="unspecified">And what,</q> said the inquisitor, <q direct="unspecified">was the passage that so
 moved thee to commiserate us?</q> 
<milestone id="p01060017" /><q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> rejoined the good man,
 <q direct="unspecified">it was that passage in the Gospel which says: You shall receive
 an hundredfold.</q> 
<milestone id="p01060018" /><q direct="unspecified">You heard aright,</q> said the inquisitor; <q direct="unspecified">but
 why did the passage so affect you?</q> 
<milestone id="p01060019" /><q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> replied the good man,
 <q direct="unspecified">I will tell you. Since I have been in attendance here, I have seen
 a crowd of poor folk receive a daily dole, now of one, now of two,
 huge tureens of swill, being the refuse from your table, and that of
 the brothers of this convent; whereof if you are to receive an hundredfold
 in the other world, you will have so much that it will go hard
 but you are all drowned therein.</q> 
<milestone id="p01060020" />This raised a general laugh
 among those who sat at the inquisitor's table, whereat the inquisitor,
 feeling that their gluttony and hypocrisy had received a home-thrust,
 was very wroth, and, but that what he had already done had not
 escaped censure, would have instituted fresh proceedings against him
 in revenge for the pleasantry with which he had rebuked the baseness
 of himself and his brother friars; so in impotent wrath he bade
 him go about his business and shew himself there no more.</p></div2><pb n="51" /><div2 type="novella" who="filostrato" id="nov0107"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01070001" />Bergamino, with a story of Primasso and the Abbot of

      and all were again silent, Filostrato, on whom the narration
      now fell, began on this wise:</p></div3><div3 who="filostrato" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01070003" />A fine thing it is, noble ladies, to hit a fixed mark; but
      if, on the sudden appearance of some strange object, it be forthwith
      hit by the bowman, 'tis little short of a miracle. <milestone id="p01070004" />The
      corrupt and filthy life of the clergy offers on many sides a fixed
      mark of iniquity at which, whoever is so minded, may let fly, with
      little doubt that they will reach it, the winged words of reproof
      and reprehension. Wherefore, though the worthy man did well
      to censure in the person of the inquisitor the pretended charity of
      the friars who give to the poor what they ought rather to give to the
      pigs or throw away, higher indeed is the praise which I accord to
      him, of whom, taking my cue from the last story, I mean to speak;
      seeing that by a clever apologue he rebuked a sudden and unwonted
      access of avarice in Messer Cane della Scala, conveying in a figure
      what he had at heart to say touching Messer Cane and himself; which
      apologue is to follow.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01070005" />Far and wide, almost to the ends of the earth, is borne the most
      illustrious renown of Messer Cane della Scala, in many ways the
      favoured child of fortune, a lord almost without a peer among the
      notables and magnificoes of Italy since the time of the Emperor
      <pb n="52" />Frederic II. <milestone id="p01070006" />Now Messer Cane, being minded to hold high
      festival at Verona, whereof fame should speak marvellous things, and
      many folk from divers parts, of whom the greater number were jesters
      of every order, being already arrived, Messer Cane did suddenly (for
      some cause or another) abandon his design, and dismissed them with
      a partial recompense. <milestone id="p01070007" />One only, Bergamino by name, a speaker
      ready and polished in a degree credible only to such as heard him,
      remained, having received no recompense or cong&#233;, still cherishing
      the hope that this omission might yet turn out to his advantage.
      But Messer Cane was possessed with the idea that whatever he
      might give Bergamino would be far more completely thrown away
      than if he had tossed it into the fire; so never a word of the sort
      said he or sent he to him. <milestone id="p01070008" />A few days thus passed, and then Bergamino,
      seeing that he was in no demand or request for aught that
      belonged to his office, and being also at heavy charges at his inn for
      the keep of his horses and servants, fell into a sort of melancholy;
      but still he waited a while, not deeming it expedient to leave. 
      <milestone id="p01070009" />He
      had brought with him three rich and goodly robes, given him by
      other lords, that he might make a brave show at the festival, and
      when his host began to press for payment he gave him one of the
      robes; afterwards, there being still much outstanding against him, he
      must needs, if he would tarry longer at the inn, give the host the
      second robe; after which he began to live on the third, being minded
      to remain there, as long as it would hold out, in expectation of better
      luck, and then to take his departure. 
      <milestone id="p01070010" />Now, while he was thus living
      on the third robe, it chanced that Messer Cane encountered him one
      day as he sate at breakfast with a very melancholy visage. Which
      Messer Cane observing, said, rather to tease him than expecting to
      elicit from him any pleasant retort: <q direct="unspecified">What ails thee, Bergamino,
	that thou art still so melancholy? Let me know the reason why.</q>
      <milestone id="p01070011" />Whereupon Bergamino, without a moment's reflection, told the
      following story, which could not have fitted his own case more
      exactly if it had been long premeditated.</p><p><q type="novella" direct="unspecified">My lord, you must know that Primasso was a grammarian of great
	eminence, and excellent and quick beyond all others in versifying;
	whereby he waxed so notable and famous that, albeit he was not
	everywhere known by sight, yet there were scarce any that did not
	at least by name and report know who Primasso was. 
	<milestone id="p01070012" />Now it so
	<pb n="53" />happened that, being once at Paris in straitened circumstances, as
	it was his lot to be most of his time by reason that virtue is little
	appreciated by the powerful, he heard speak of the Abbot of Cluny,
	who, except the Pope, is supposed to be the richest prelate, in regard
	of his vast revenues, that the Church of God can shew; and marvellous
	and magnificent things were told him of the perpetual court
	which the abbot kept, and how, wherever he was, he denied not to
	any that came there either meat or drink, so only that he preferred
	his request while the abbot was at table. <milestone id="p01070013" />Which when
	Primasso heard, he determined to go and see for himself what
	magnificent state this abbot kept, for he was one that took great
	delight in observing the ways of powerful and lordly men; wherefore
	he asked how far from Paris was the abbot then sojourning. He
	was informed that the abbot was then at one of his places distant
	perhaps six miles; which Primasso concluded he could reach in time
	for breakfast, if he started early in the morning. <milestone id="p01070014" />When he had
	learned the way, he found that no one else was travelling by it, and
	fearing lest by mischance he should lose it, and so find himself where
	it would not be easy for him to get food, he determined to obviate so
	disagreeable a contingency by taking with him three loaves of bread--as
	for drink, water, though not much to his taste, was, he supposed,
	to be found everywhere. So, having disposed the loaves in the fold of
	his tunic, he took the road and made such progress that he reached
	the abbot's place of sojourn before the breakfast-hour. 
	<milestone id="p01070015" />Having
	entered, he made the circuit of the entire place, observing everything,
	the vast array of tables, and the vast kitchen well-appointed with all
	things needful for the preparation and service of the breakfast, and
	saying to himself: <q type="internalmonologue" direct="unspecified" who="primasso">In very truth this
	  man is even such a magnifico
	  as he is reported to be.</q> <milestone id="p01070016" />While his attention was thus occupied,
	the abbot's seneschal, it being now breakfast-time, gave order to serve
	water for the hands, which being washen, they sat them all down to
	breakfast. Now it so happened that Primasso was placed immediately
	in front of the door by which the abbot must pass from his chamber
	into the hall; 
	<milestone id="p01070017" />in which, according to rule of his court, neither wine,
	nor bread, nor aught else drinkable or eatable was ever set on the
	tables before he made his appearance and was seated. The seneschal,
	therefore, having set the tables, sent word to the abbot, that all
	was now ready, and they waited only his pleasure. 
	<milestone id="p01070018" />So the abbot
	<pb n="54" />gave the word, the door of his chamber was thrown open, and he
	took a step or two forward towards the hall, gazing straight in front
	of him as he went. Thus it fell out that the first man on whom he
	set eyes was Primasso, who was in very sorry trim. The abbot, who
	knew him not by sight, no sooner saw him, than, surprised by a
	churlish mood to which he had hitherto been an entire stranger, he
	said to himself: 
	<milestone id="p01070019" /><q type="internalmonologue" direct="unspecified" who="abatecligni">So it is
	  to such as this man that I give my hospitality;</q>
	and going back into the chamber he bade lock the door, and
	asked of his attendants whether the vile fellow that sate at table
	directly opposite the door was known to any of them, <milestone id="p01070020" />who, one and all,
	answered in the negative. Primasso waited a little, but he was not
	used to fast, and his journey had whetted his appetite. So, as the abbot
	did not return, he drew out one of the loaves which he had brought
	with him, and began to eat. <milestone id="p01070021" />The abbot, after a while, bade one of
	his servants go see whether Primasso were gone. The servant
	returned with the answer: <q direct="unspecified">No, sir, and (what is more) he is
	  eating a loaf of bread, which he seems to have brought with him.</q>
	<q direct="unspecified" who="abatecligni">Be it so then,</q> said the abbot, <milestone id="p01070022" />who was
	vexed that he was not gone
	of his own accord, but was not disposed to turn him out; <q direct="unspecified">let him
	  eat his own bread, if he have any, for he shall have none of ours today.</q>
	By and by Primasso, having finished his first loaf, began, as
	the abbot did not make his appearance, to eat the second; which was
	likewise reported to the abbot, who had again sent to see if he were
	gone. <milestone id="p01070023" />Finally, as the abbot still delayed his coming, Primasso,
	having finished the second loaf, began upon the third; whereof, once
	more, word was carried to the abbot, who now began to commune
	with himself and say: <q direct="unspecified" who="abatecligni">Alas! my soul, what unwonted mood
	  harbourest thou to-day? What avarice? what scorn? and of whom?
	  I have given my hospitality, now for many a year, to whoso craved
	  it, without looking to see whether he were gentle or churl, poor or
	  rich, merchant or cheat, and mine eyes have seen it squandered on
	  vile fellows without number; and nought of that which I feel
	  towards this man ever entered my mind. <milestone id="p01070024" />Assuredly it cannot be that
	  he is a man of no consequence, who is the occasion of this access of
	  avarice in me. Though he seem to me a vile fellow, he must be some
	  great man, that my mind is thus obstinately averse to do him honour.</q>
	<milestone id="p01070025" />Of which musings the upshot was that he sent to inquire who the
	vile fellow was, and learning that he was Primasso, come to see if what
	<pb n="55" />he had heard of his magnificent state were true, he was stricken with
	shame, having heard of old Primasso's fame, and knowing him to be
	a great man. Wherefore, being zealous to make him the amend, he
	studied to do him honour in many ways; <milestone id="p01070026" />and after breakfast, that
	his garb might accord with his native dignity, he caused him to be
	nobly arrayed, and setting him upon a palfrey and filling his purse,
	left it to his own choice, whether to go or to stay. So Primasso, with
	a full heart, thanked him for his courtesy in terms the amplest that
	he could command, and, having left Paris afoot, returned thither on
	horseback.</q></p><p><milestone id="p01070027" />Messer Cane was shrewd enough to apprehend Bergamino's
	meaning perfectly well without a gloss, and said with a smile:
	<q direct="unspecified">Bergamino, thy parable is apt, and declares to me very plainly
	  thy losses, my avarice, and what thou desirest of me. And in good
	  sooth this access of avarice, of which thou art the occasion, is the
	  first that I have experienced. But I will expel the intruder with
	  the b&#226;ton which thou thyself hast furnished.</q> 
	<milestone id="p01070028" />So he paid Bergamino's
	reckoning, habited him nobly in one of his own robes, gave
	him money and a palfrey, and left it for the time at his discretion,
	whether to go or to stay.</p></div2><pb n="56" /><div2 type="novella" who="lauretta" id="nov0108"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01080001" />Guglielmo Borsiere by a neat retort sharply censures

 be the less appreciated by you, because it has a happy termination.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01080004" />Know then that in Genoa there dwelt long ago a gentleman,
 who was known as Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, and whose wealth,
 both in lands and money, was generally supposed to be far in excess
 of that of any other burgher then in Italy; <milestone id="p01080005" />and as in wealth he was
 without a rival in Italy, so in meanness and avarice there was not
 any in the entire world, however richly endowed with those qualities,
 whom he did not immeasurably surpass, insomuch that, not only
 did he keep a tight grip upon his purse when honour was to be done
 to another, but in his personal expenditure, even upon things meet
 and proper, contrary to the general custom of the Genoese, whose
 wont is to array themselves nobly, he was extremely penurious, as
 also in his outlay upon his table. <milestone id="p01080006" />Wherefore, not without just cause,
 folk had dropped his surname de' Grimaldi, and called him instead
 Messer Ermino Avarizia. <milestone id="p01080007" />While thus by thrift his wealth waxed
 greater and greater, it so chanced that there came to Genoa a jester
 of good parts, a man debonair and ready of speech, his name
 Guglielmo Borsiere, whose like is not to be found to-day, when
 <pb n="57" />jesters (to the great reproach be it spoken of those that claim the
 name and reputation of gentlemen) are rather to be called asses,
 being without courtly breeding, and formed after the coarse pattern
 of the basest of churls. <milestone id="p01080008" />And whereas in the days of which I speak
 they made it their business, they spared no pains, to compose quarrels,
 to allay heart-burnings, between gentlemen, or arrange marriages, or
 leagues of amity, ministering meanwhile relief to jaded minds and
 solace to courts by the sprightly sallies of their wit, and with keen
 sarcasm, like fathers, censuring churlish manners, being also satisfied
 with very trifling guerdons; <milestone id="p01080009" />nowadays all their care is to spend their
 time in scandal-mongering, in sowing discord, in saying, and (what
 is worse) in doing in the presence of company things churlish and
 flagitious, in bringing accusations, true or false, of wicked, shameful
 or flagitious conduct against one another; and in drawing gentlemen
 into base and nefarious practices by sinister and insidious arts. 
<milestone id="p01080010" />And
 by these wretched and depraved lords he is held most dear and best
 rewarded whose words and deeds are the most atrocious, to the
 great reproach and scandal of the world of to-day; whereby it is
 abundantly manifest that virtue has departed from the earth, leaving
 a degenerate generation to wallow in the lowest depths of vice.</p><p><milestone id="p01080011" />But reverting to the point at which I started, wherefrom under
 stress of just indignation I have deviated somewhat further than I
 intended, I say that the said Guglielmo was had in honour, and was
 well received by all the gentlemen of Genoa; and tarrying some
 days in the city, heard much of the meanness and avarice of Messer
 Ermino, and was curious to see him. <milestone id="p01080012" />Now Messer Ermino had
 heard that this Guglielmo Borsiere was a man of good parts, and,
 notwithstanding his avarice, having in him some sparks of good
 breeding, received him with words of hearty greeting and a gladsome
 mien, and conversed freely with him and of divers matters, and so
 conversing, took him with other Genoese that were of his company
 to a new and very beautiful house which he had built, 
<milestone id="p01080013" />and after
 shewing him over the whole of it, said to him: <q direct="unspecified">Now, Messer
 Guglielmo, you have seen and heard many things; could you suggest
 to me something, the like of which has not hitherto been seen,
 which I might have painted here in the saloon of this house?</q> 
<milestone id="p01080014" />To
 which ill-judged question Guglielmo replied: <q direct="unspecified">Sir, it would not, I
 think, be in my power to suggest anything the like of which has
 <pb n="58" />never been seen, unless it were a sneeze or something similar; but
 if it so please you, I have something to suggest, which, I think, you
 have never seen.</q> 
<milestone id="p01080015" /><q direct="unspecified">Prithee, what may that be?</q> said Messer
 Ermino, not expecting to get the answer which he got. 
<milestone id="p01080016" />For
 Guglielmo replied forthwith: <q direct="unspecified">Paint Courtesy here;</q> 
<milestone id="p01080017" />which Messer
 Ermino had no sooner heard, than he was so stricken with shame
 that his disposition underwent a complete change, and he said:
 <q direct="unspecified">Messer Guglielmo, I will see to it that Courtesy is here painted
 in such wise that neither you nor any one else shall ever again have
 reason to tell me that I have not seen or known that virtue.</q> 
<milestone id="p01080018" />And
 henceforward (so enduring was the change wrought by Guglielmo's

      by some unpremeditated casual word. This is plainly manifest
      by the story told by Lauretta; and by mine, which will be of the
      briefest, I mean further to illustrate it; seeing that, good stories,
      being always pleasurable, are worth listening to with attention, no
      matter by whom they may be told.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01090004" />'Twas, then, in the time of the first king of Cyprus, after the
      conquest made of the Holy Land by Godfrey de Bouillon, that a
      lady of Gascony made a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, and on
      her way home, having landed at Cyprus, met with brutal outrage
      at the hands of certain ruffians. <milestone id="p01090005" />Broken-hearted and disconsolate
      she determined to make her complaint to the king; but she was told
      that it would be all in vain, because so spiritless and
      fain&#232;ant
      was he that he not only neglected to avenge affronts put upon others, but
      endured with a reprehensible tameness those which were offered
      to himself, insomuch that whoso had any ill-humour to vent, took
      occasion to vex or mortify him. <milestone id="p01090006" />The lady, hearing this report,
      despaired of redress, and by way of alleviation of her grief determined
      to make the king sensible of his baseness. So in tears she presented
      herself before him and said: <q direct="unspecified">Sire, it is not to seek redress of the
	wrong done me that I come here before you: but only that, so please
	you, I may learn of you how it is that you suffer patiently the wrongs
	<pb n="60" />which, as I understand, are done you; that thus schooled by you in
	patience I may endure my own, which, God knows, I would gladly,
	were it possible, transfer to you, seeing that you are so well fitted to
	bear them.</q> <milestone id="p01090007" />These words aroused the hitherto sluggish and apathetic
      king as it were from sleep. He redressed the lady's wrong, and having
      thus made a beginning, thenceforth meted out the most rigorous
      justice to all that in any wise offended against the majesty of his
      crown.</p></div2><pb n="61" /><div2 type="novella" who="pampinea" id="nov0110"><head>Novel X.</head><argument><p><milestone id="p01100001" />Master Alberto da Bologna honourably puts to shame a
 lady who sought occasion to put him to shame in that
 he was in love with her.</p></argument><div3 who="author" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01100002" />After Elisa had done, it only remained for the queen to conclude
	the day's story-telling, and thus with manner debonair did she begin:</p></div3><div3 who="pampinea" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p01100003" />As stars in the serene expanse of heaven, as in spring-time
 flowers in the green pastures, so, honourable damsels, in the hour of
 rare and excellent converse is wit with its bright sallies. 
<milestone id="p01100004" />Which,
 being brief, are much more proper for ladies than for men, seeing
 that prolixity of speech, when brevity is possible, is much less allowable
 to them; albeit (shame be to us all and all our generation) few
 ladies or none are left to-day who understand aught that is wittily
 said, or understanding are able to answer it. <milestone id="p01100005" />For the place of those
 graces of the spirit which distinguished the ladies of the past has now
 been usurped by adornments of the person; and she whose dress is
 most richly and variously and curiously dight, accounts herself more
 worthy to be had in honour, forgetting, that, were one but so to
 array him, an ass would carry a far greater load of finery than any
 of them, and for all that be not a whit the more deserving of honour.
 <milestone id="p01100006" />I blush to say this, for in censuring others I condemn myself.
 Tricked out, bedecked, bedizened thus, we are either silent and
 impassive as statues, or, if we answer aught that is said to us, much
 better were it we had held our peace. And we make believe,
 forsooth, that our failure to acquit ourselves in converse with our
 equals of either sex does but proceed from guilelessness; dignifying
 stupidity by the name of modesty, as if no lady could be modest and
 converse with other folk than her maid or laundress or bake-house
 <pb n="62" />woman; which if Nature had intended, as we feign she did, she would
 have set other limits to our garrulousness. 
<milestone id="p01100007" />True it is that in this, as
 in other matters, time and place and person are to be regarded;
 because it sometimes happens that a lady or gentleman thinking by
 some sally of wit to put another to shame, has rather been put to
 shame by that other, having failed duly to estimate their relative
 powers. <milestone id="p01100008" />Wherefore, that you may be on your guard against such
 error, and, further, that in you be not exemplified the common
 proverb, to wit, that women do ever and on all occasions choose the
 worst, I trust that this last of to-day's stories, which falls to me to
 tell, may serve you as a lesson; that, as you are distinguished from
 others by nobility of nature, so you may also shew yourselves
 separate from them by excellence of manners.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p01100009" />There lived not many years ago, perhaps yet lives, in Bologna, a
 very great physician, so great that the fame of his skill was noised
 abroad throughout almost the entire world.</p><p>Now Master Alberto (such was his name) was of so noble a
 temper that, <milestone id="p01100010" />being now nigh upon seventy years of age, and all but
 devoid of natural heat of body, he was yet receptive of the flames of
 love; and having at an assembly seen a very beautiful widow lady,
 Madonna Malgherida de' Ghisolieri, as some say, and being charmed
 with her beyond measure, was, notwithstanding his age, no less
 ardently enamoured than a young man, insomuch that he was not
 well able to sleep at night, unless during the day he had seen the fair
 lady's lovely and delicate features. <milestone id="p01100011" />Wherefore he began to frequent
 the vicinity of her house, passing to and fro in front of it, now on
 foot now on horseback, as occasion best served. 
<milestone id="p01100012" />Which she and many
 other ladies perceiving, made merry together more than once, to see
 a man of his years and discretion in love, as if they deemed that this
 most delightful passion of love were only fit for empty-headed youths,
 and could not in men be either harboured or engendered. 
<milestone id="p01100013" />Master Alberto thus continuing to haunt the front of the house, it so
 happened that one feast-day the lady with other ladies was seated
 before her door, and Master Alberto's approach being thus observed
 by them for some time before he arrived, they complotted to receive
 him and shew him honour, and then to rally him on his love; 
<milestone id="p01100014" />and so they did, rising with one accord to receive him, bidding him
 welcome, and ushering him into a cool courtyard, where they regaled
 <pb n="63" />him with the finest wines and comfits; which done, in a tone of
 refined and sprightly banter they asked him how it came about that
 he was enamoured of this fair lady, seeing that she was beloved of
 many a fine gentleman of youth and spirit. 
<milestone id="p01100015" />Master Alberto, being
 thus courteously assailed, put a blithe face on it, and answered:
 <q direct="unspecified">Madam, my love for you need surprise none that is conversant
 with such matters, and least of all you that are worthy of it. 
<milestone id="p01100016" />And though old men, of course, have lost the strength which love demands
 for its full fruition, yet are they not therefore without the
 good intent and just appreciation of what beseems the accepted lover,
 but indeed understand it far better than young men, by reason that
 they have more experience. 
<milestone id="p01100017" />My hope in thus old aspiring to love
 you, who are loved by so many young men, is founded on what I
 have frequently observed of ladies' ways at lunch, when they trifle
 with the lupin and the leek. In the leek no part is good, but the
 head is at any rate not so bad as the rest, and indeed not unpalatable;
 you, however, for the most part, following a depraved taste, hold it in
 your hand and munch the leaves, which are not only of no account
 but actually distasteful. <milestone id="p01100018" />How am I to know, madam, that in your
 selection of lovers, you are not equally eccentric? In which case I
 should be the man of your choice, and the rest would be cast aside.</q>
 <milestone id="p01100019" />Whereto the gentle lady, somewhat shame-stricken, as were also her
 fair friends, thus made answer: <q direct="unspecified">Master Alberto, our presumption
 has received from you a most just and no less courteous reproof; but
 your love is dear to me, as should ever be that of a wise and worthy
 man. And therefore, saving my honour, I am yours, entirely and
 devotedly at your pleasure and command.</q> 
<milestone id="p01100020" />This speech brought
 Master Alberto to his feet, and the others also rising, he thanked the
 lady for her courtesy, bade her a gay and smiling adieu, and so
 left the house. Thus the lady, not considering on whom she exercised
 her wit, thinking to conquer was conquered herself: against
 which mishap you, if you are discreet, will ever be most strictly on
 your guard.</p></div2><div2 type="conclusion" who="author" id="d01conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone id="p01970001" />As the young ladies and the three young men finished their story-telling
      the sun was westering and the heat of the day in great
      measure abated. <milestone id="p01970002" />Which their queen observing, debonairly thus she
      spoke: <q direct="unspecified">Now, dear gossips, my day of sovereignty draws to a close,
	and nought remains for me to do but to give you a new queen, by
	<pb n="64" />whom on the morrow our common life may be ordered as she may
	deem best in a course of seemly pleasure; and though there seems to
	be still some interval between day and night, yet, as whoso does not
	in some degree anticipate the course of time, cannot well provide for
	the future; and in order that what the new queen shall decide to be
	meet for the morrow may be made ready beforehand, I decree that
	from this time forth the days begin at this hour. <milestone id="p01970003" />And so in reverent
	submission to Him, in whom is the life of all beings, for our comfort
	and solace we commit the governance of our realm for the morrow
	into the hands of Queen Filomena, most discreet of damsels.</q> 
      <milestone id="p01970004" />So saying she arose, took the laurel wreath from her brow, and with a
      gesture of reverence set it on the brow of Filomena, whom she then,
      and after her all the other ladies and the young men, saluted as
      queen, doing her due and graceful homage.</p><p><milestone id="p01970005" />Queen Filomena modestly blushed a little to find herself thus
      invested with the sovereignty; but, being put on her mettle by
      Pampinea's recent admonitions, she was minded not to seem awkward,
      and soon recovered her composure. She then began by confirming
      all the appointments made by Pampinea, and making all needful
      arrangements for the following morning and evening, which they
      were to pass where they then were. Whereupon she thus spoke:
      <milestone id="p01970006" /><q direct="unspecified">Dearest gossips, though, thanks rather to Pampinea's courtesy than
	to merit of mine, I am made queen of you all; yet I am not on
	that account minded to have respect merely to my own judgment in
	the governance of our life, but to unite your wisdom with mine; and
	that you may understand what I think of doing, and by consequence
	may be able to amplify or curtail it at your pleasure, I will in few
	words make known to you my purpose. <milestone id="p01970007" />The course observed by
	Pampinea to-day, if I have judged aright, seems to be alike commendable
	and delectable; wherefore, until by lapse of time, or for some
	other cause, it grow tedious, I purpose not to alter it. 
	<milestone id="p01970008" />So when we
	have arranged for what we have already taken in hand, we will go
	hence and enjoy a short walk; at sundown we will sup in the cool;
	and we will then sing a few songs and otherwise divert ourselves,
	until it is time to go to sleep. <milestone id="p01970009" />To-morrow we will rise in the cool
	of the morning, and after enjoying another walk, each at his or her
	sweet will, we will return, as to-day, and in due time break our fast,
	dance, sleep, and having risen, will here resume our story-telling,
	<pb n="65" />wherein, methinks, pleasure and profit unite in superabundant
	measure. <milestone id="p01970010" />True it is that Pampinea, by reason of her late election to
	the sovereignty, neglected one matter, which I mean to introduce,
	to wit, the circumscription of the topic of our story-telling, and its
	preassignment, that each may be able to premeditate some apt story
	bearing upon the theme; and seeing that from the beginning of the
	world Fortune has made men the sport of divers accidents, and so it
	will continue until the end, the theme, so please you, shall in each
	case be the same; 
	<milestone id="p01970011" /><seg type="topic">to wit, the fortune of such as after divers adventures
	  have at last attained a goal of unexpected felicity.</seg></q></p><p><milestone id="p01970012" />The ladies and the young men alike commended the rule thus
      laid down, and agreed to follow it. Dioneo, however, when the rest
      had done speaking, said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, as all the rest have said, so say
	I, briefly, that the rule prescribed by you is commendable and delectable;
	but of your especial grace I crave a favour, which, I trust,
	may be granted and continued to me, so long as our company shall
	endure; which favour is this: that I be not bound by the assigned
	theme if I am not so minded, but that I have leave to choose such
	topic as best shall please me. <milestone id="p01970013" />And lest any suppose that I crave this
	grace as one that has not stories ready to hand, I am henceforth
	content that mine be always the last.</q> 
      <milestone id="p01970014" />The queen, knowing him to
      be a merry and facetious fellow, and feeling sure that he only craved
      this favour in order that, if the company were jaded, he might have
      an opportunity to recreate them by some amusing story, gladly, with
      the consent of the rest, granted his petition. 
      <milestone id="p01970015" />She then rose, and
      attended by the rest sauntered towards a stream, which, issuing clear
      as crystal from a neighbouring hill, precipitated itself into a valley
      shaded by trees close set amid living rock and fresh green herbage.
      Bare of foot and arm they entered the stream, and roving hither and
      thither amused themselves in divers ways till <milestone id="p01970016" />in due time they returned
      to the palace, and gaily supped. Supper ended, the queen sent for
      instruments of music, and bade Lauretta lead a dance, while Emilia
      was to sing a song accompanied by Dioneo on the lute.</p><p><milestone id="p01970017" />Accordingly Lauretta led a dance, while Emilia with passion
      sang the following song:</p><div3 who="emilia" type="song"><lg><milestone id="p01970018" />
	<l>So fain I am of my own loveliness,</l>
	<l>I hope, nor think not e'er</l>
	<l>The weight to feel of other amorousness.</l>
      </lg><pb n="66" /><lg><milestone id="p01970019" />
	<l>When in the mirror I my face behold,</l>
	<l>That see I there which doth my mind content,</l>
	<l>Nor any present hap or memory old</l>
	<l>May me deprive of such sweet ravishment.</l>
	<l>Where else, then, should I find such blandishment</l>
	<l>Of sight and sense that e'er</l>
	<l>My heart should know another amorousness?</l>
      </lg><lg><milestone id="p01970020" />
	<l>Nor need I fear lest the fair thing retreat,</l>
	<l>When fain I am my solace to renew;</l>
	<l>Rather, I know, 'twill me advance to meet,</l>
	<l>To pleasure me, and shew so sweet a view</l>
	<l>That speech or thought of none its semblance true</l>
	<l>Paint or conceive may e'er,</l>
	<l>Unless he burn with ev'n such amorousness.</l>
      </lg><lg><milestone id="p01970021" />
	<l>Thereon as more intent I gaze, the fire</l>
	<l>Waxeth within me hourly more and more,</l>
	<l>Myself I yield thereto, myself entire,</l>
	<l>And foretaste have of what it hath in store,</l>
	<l>And hope of greater joyance than before,</l>
	<l>Nay, such as ne'er</l>
	<l>None knew; for ne'er was felt such amorousness.</l>
      </lg></div3><p><milestone id="p01970022" />This ballade, to which all heartily responded, albeit its words
      furnished much matter of thought to some, was followed by some
      other dances, and part of the brief night being thus spent, the queen
      proclaimed the first day ended, and bade light the torches, that all
      might go to rest until the following morning; and so, seeking their
      several chambers, to rest they went.</p></div2></div1>
