  The
  luminary, before whose splendour the night takes wing, had
 already changed the eighth heaven
  <note>
   I. e.
   in the Ptolemaic
 system,
 the region of the fixed stars.

  from azure to the lighter
 blue,
  <note>
   Cilestro:
   a word for which we have no exact equivalent, the
 dominant
 note of the Italian sky, when the sun is well up, being its intense
 luminosity.

  and in the meads the flowerets were beginning to lift their heads,
 when Emilia, being risen, roused her fair gossips, and, likewise, the
 young men. And so the queen leading the way at an easy pace, and
 the rest of the company following, they hied them to a copse at no
 great distance from the palace. Where, being entered, they saw the
 goats and stags and other wild creatures, as if witting that in this
 time of pestilence they had nought to fear from the hunter, stand
 awaiting them with no more sign of fear than if they had been

  and so, making now towards this, now towards the other of

  A while they rested, nor went they to table until six ditties, each
 gayer than that which went before, had been sung by the young
  men and the ladies; which done, they washed their hands, and all by
 the queen's command were ranged by the seneschal at the table;
 and, the viands being served, they cheerily took their meal: wherefrom

  However, the accustomed hour being come, they all
 gathered at the wonted spot for their discoursing, and the queen,
