 wise, as from matters that not seldom fell within my own observation
 and reading, I formed the opinion that the vehement and
 scorching blast of envy was apt to vent itself only upon lofty towers
      or the highest tree-tops: but therein I find that I misjudged; <milestone id="p04980003" />for,
 whereas I ever sought and studied how best to elude the buffetings
 of that furious hurricane, and to that end kept a course not merely
 on the plain, but, by preference, in the depth of the valley; as
 should be abundantly clear to whoso looks at these little stories,
 written as they are not only in the vulgar Florentine, and in prose,
 and without dedicatory flourish, but also in as homely and simple a
 style as may be; <milestone id="p04980004" />nevertheless all this has not stood me in such stead
 but that I have been shrewdly shaken, nay, all but uprooted by the
 blast, and altogether lacerated by the bite of this same envy.
 Whereby I may very well understand that 'tis true, what the sages
 aver, that only misery is exempt from envy in the present life.
 <milestone id="p04980005" />Know then, discreet my ladies, that some there are, who, reading
 these little stories, have alleged that I am too fond of you, and that
 'tis not a seemly thing that I should take so much pleasure in
 ministering to your gratification and solace; and some have found
 more fault with me for praising you as I do. <milestone id="p04980006" />Others, affecting to
 deliver a more considered judgment, have said that it ill befits my
 time of life to ensue such matters, to wit, the discoursing of women,
 or endeavouring to pleasure them. And not a few, feigning a mighty
 tender regard to my fame, aver that I should do more wisely to keep
 <pb n="259" />ever with the Muses on Parnassus, than to forgather with you in such
 vain dalliance. <milestone id="p04980007" />Those again there are, who, evincing less wisdom
 than despite, have told me that I should shew sounder sense if I
 bethought me how to get my daily bread, than, going after these idle
 toys, to nourish myself upon the wind; while certain others, in
 disparagement of my work, strive might and main to make it appear
 that the matters which I relate fell out otherwise than as I set them
 forth. <milestone id="p04980008" />Such then, noble ladies, are the blasts, such the sharp and
 cruel fangs, by which, while I champion your cause, I am assailed,
 harassed and well-nigh pierced through and through. <milestone id="p04980009" />Which
 censures I hear and mark, God knows, with equal mind: and,
 though to you belongs all my defence, yet I mean not to be niggard
 of my own powers, but rather, without dealing out to them the
 castigation they deserve, to give them such slight answer as may
 secure my ears some respite of their clamour; and that without
 delay; <milestone id="p04980010" />seeing that, if already, though I have not completed the
 third part of my work, they are not a few and very presumptuous, I
 deem it possible, that before I have reached the end, should they
 receive no check, they may have grown so numerous, that 'twould
 scarce tax their powers to sink me; and that your forces, great though
 they be, would not suffice to withstand them. <milestone id="p04980011" />However I am
 minded to answer none of them, until I have related in my behoof,
 not indeed an entire story, for I would not seem to foist my stories in
 among those of so honourable a company as that with which I have
 made you acquainted, but a part of one, that its very incompleteness
 may shew that it is not one of them: wherefore, addressing my
 assailants, I say: <milestone id="p04980012" />That in our city there was in old time a citizen
 named Filippo Balducci, a man of quite low origin, but of good
 substance and well versed and expert in matters belonging to his
 condition, who had a wife that he most dearly loved, as did she him,
 so that their life passed in peace and concord, nor there was aught
 they studied so much as how to please each other perfectly. <milestone id="p04980013" />Now it
 came to pass, as it does to every one, that the good lady departed this
 life, leaving Filippo nought of hers but an only son, that she had had
 by him, and who was then about two years old. <milestone id="p04980014" />His wife's death left
 Filippo as disconsolate as ever was any man for the loss of a loved
 one: and sorely missing the companionship that was most dear to
 him, he resolved to have done with the world, and devote himself
 <pb n="260" />and his little son to the service of God. <milestone id="p04980015" />Wherefore, having dedicated
 all his goods to charitable uses, he forthwith betook him to the summit
 of Monte Asinaio, where he installed himself with his son in a little
 cell, and living on alms, passed his days in fasting and prayer, being
 careful above all things to say nothing to the boy of any temporal
 matters, nor to let him see aught of the kind, lest they should
 distract his mind from his religious exercises, but discoursing with
 him continually of the glory of the life eternal and of God and the
 saints, and teaching him nought else but holy orisons: in which way
 of life he kept him not a few years, never suffering him to quit the
 cell or see aught but himself. <milestone id="p04980016" />From time to time the worthy man
 would go Florence, where divers of the faithful would afford him
 relief according to his needs, and so he would return to his cell.
 <milestone id="p04980017" />And thus it fell out that one day Filippo, now an aged man, being
 asked by the boy, who was about eighteen years old, whither he went,
 told him. Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Father,</q> said the boy, <q direct="unspecified">you are now old,
 and scarce able to support fatigue; why take you me not with you
 for once to Florence, and give me to know devout friends of God
 and you, so that I, who am young and fitter for such exertion than
 you, may thereafter go to Florence for our supplies at your pleasure,
 and you remain here?</q></p><p><milestone id="p04980018" />The worthy man, bethinking him that his son was now grown
 up, and so habituated to the service of God as hardly to be seduced
 by the things of the world, said to himself: <q direct="unspecified">He says tell.</q> And
 so, as he must needs go to Florence, he took the boy with him.
 <milestone id="p04980019" />Where, seeing the palaces, the houses, the churches, and all matters
 else with which the city abounds, and of which he had no more
 recollection than if he had never seen them, the boy found all passing
 strange, and questioned his father of not a few of them, what they
 were and how they were named; <milestone id="p04980020" />his curiosity being no sooner
 satisfied in one particular than he plied his father with a further
 question. And so it befell that, while son and father were thus
 occupied in asking and answering questions, they encountered a bevy
 of damsels, fair and richly arrayed, being on their return from a
 wedding; whom the young man no sooner saw, than he asked his
 father what they might be. 
<milestone id="p04980021" /><q direct="unspecified">My son,</q> answered the father, <q direct="unspecified">fix
 thy gaze on the ground, regard them not at all, for naughty things
 are they.</q> 
<milestone id="p04980022" /><q direct="unspecified">Oh!</q> said the son, <q direct="unspecified">and what is their name?</q> 
<milestone id="p04980023" />The
 <pb n="261" />father, fearing to awaken some mischievous craving of concupiscence
 in the young man, would not denote them truly, to wit, as women,
 but said: <q direct="unspecified">They are called goslings.</q> 
<milestone id="p04980024" />Whereupon, wonderful
 to tell! the lad who had never before set eyes on any woman,
 thought no more of the palaces, the oxen, the horses, the asses,
 the money, or aught else that he had seen, but exclaimed:
 <q direct="unspecified">Prithee, father, let me have one of those goslings.</q> 
<milestone id="p04980025" /><q direct="unspecified">Alas,
 my son,</q> replied the father, <q direct="unspecified">speak not of them; they are
 naughty things.</q> 
<milestone id="p04980026" /><q direct="unspecified">Oh!</q> questioned the son; <q direct="unspecified">but are naughty
 things made like that?</q> 
<milestone id="p04980027" /><q direct="unspecified">Ay,</q> returned the father. 
<milestone id="p04980028" />Whereupon
 the son: <q direct="unspecified">I know not,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">what you say, nor why they
 should be naughty things: for my part I have as yet seen nought
 that seemed to me so fair and delectable. They are fairer than the
 painted angels that you have so often shewn me. Oh! if you love
 me, do but let us take one of these goslings up there, and I will see
 that she have whereon to bill.</q> 
<milestone id="p04980029" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay,</q> said the father, <q direct="unspecified">that will
 not I. Thou knowest not whereon they bill;</q> and straightway,
 being ware that nature was more potent than his art, he repented
 him that he had brought the boy to Florence.</p><p><milestone id="p04980030" />But enough of this story: 'tis time for me to cut it short, and
 return to those, for whose instruction 'tis told. They say then,
 some of these my censors, that I am too fond of you, young ladies,
 and am at too great pains to pleasure you. Now that I am fond of
 you, and am at pains to pleasure you, <milestone id="p04980031" />I do most frankly and fully
 confess; and I ask them whether, considering only all that it means
 to have had, and to have continually, before one's eyes your debonair
 demeanour, your bewitching beauty and exquisite grace, and therewithal
 your modest womanliness, not to speak of having known the
 amorous kisses, the caressing embraces, the voluptuous comminglings,
 whereof our intercourse with you, ladies most sweet, not seldom is
 productive, they do verily marvel that I am fond of you, seeing that
 one who was nurtured, reared, and brought up on a savage and solitary
 mountain, within the narrow circuit of a cell, without other companion
 than his father, had no sooner seen you than 'twas you alone
 that he desired, that he demanded, that he sought with ardour?
 <milestone id="p04980032" />Will they tear, will they lacerate me with their censures, if I,
 whose body Heaven fashioned all apt for love, whose soul from
 very boyhood was dedicate to you, am not insensible to the power
 <pb n="262" />of the light of your eyes, to the sweetness of your honeyed words,
 to the flame that is kindled by your gentle sighs, but am fond of you
 and sedulous to pleasure you; you, again I bid them remember,
 in whom a hermit, a rude, witless lad, liker to an animal than to a
 human being, found more to delight him than in aught else that he
 saw? Of a truth whoso taxes me thus must be one that, feeling,
 knowing nought of the pleasure and power of natural affection, loves
 you not, nor craves your love; and such an one I hold in light esteem.
 <milestone id="p04980033" />And as for those that go about to find ground of exception in my
 age, they do but shew that they ill understand that the leek, albeit
 its head is white, has a green tail. But jesting apart, thus I answer
 them, that never to the end of my life shall I deem it shameful to
 me to pleasure those to whom Guido Cavalcanti and Dante Alighieri
 in their old age, and Messer Cino da Pistoia in extreme old age,
 accounted it an honour and found it a delight to minister gratification.
 <milestone id="p04980034" />And but that 'twere a deviation from the use and wont of
 discourse, I would call history to my aid, and shew it to abound
 with stories of noble men of old time, who in their ripest age studied
 above all things else to pleasure the ladies; whereof if they be
 ignorant, go they and get them to school. <milestone id="p04980035" />To keep with the Muses
 on Parnassus is counsel I approve; but tarry with them always we
 cannot, nor they with us, nor is a man blameworthy, if, when he
 happen to part from them, he find his delight in those that resemble
 them. The Muses are ladies, and albeit ladies are not the peers of
 the Muses, yet they have their outward semblance; for which cause,
 if for no other, 'tis reasonable that I should be fond of them.
 Besides which, ladies have been to me the occasion of composing
 some thousand verses, but of never a verse that I made were the
 Muses the occasion. <milestone id="p04980036" />Howbeit 'twas with their aid, 'twas under their
 influence that I composed those thousand verses, and perchance they
 have sometimes visited me to encourage me in my present task, humble
 indeed though it be, doing honour and paying, as it were, tribute,
 to the likeness which the ladies have to them; wherefore, while I
 weave these stories, I stray not so far from Mount Parnassus and the
 Muses as not a few perchance suppose. <milestone id="p04980037" />But what shall we say to
 those, in whom my hunger excites such commiseration that they
 bid me get me bread? Verily I know not, save this: Suppose that
 in my need I were to beg bread of them, what would be their
 <pb n="263" />answer? I doubt not they would say: <q direct="unspecified">Go seek it among the
 fables.</q> 
<milestone id="p04980038" />And in sooth the poets have found more bread among their
 fables than many rich men among their treasures. And many that
 have gone after fables have crowned their days with splendour, while,
 on the other hand, not a few, in the endeavour to get them more
 bread than they needed, have perished miserably. But why waste
 more words on them? Let them send me packing, when I ask
 bread of them; not that, thank God, I have yet need of it, and
 should I ever come to be in need of it, I know, like the Apostle,
 how to abound and to be in want, and so am minded to be beholden
 to none but myself. <milestone id="p04980039" />As for those who say that these matters fell out
 otherwise than as I relate them, I should account it no small favour,
 if they would produce the originals, and should what I write not
 accord with them, I would acknowledge the justice of their censure,
 and study to amend my ways; but, until better evidence is forthcoming
 than their words, I shall adhere to my own opinion without
 seeking to deprive them of theirs, and give them tit for tat. <milestone id="p04980040" />And
 being minded that for this while this answer suffice, I say that with
 God and you, in whom I trust, most gentle ladies, to aid and protect
 me, and patience for my stay, I shall go forward with my work,
 turning my back on this tempest, however it may rage; for I see
 not that I can fare worse than the fine dust, which the blast of the
 whirlwind either leaves where it lies, or bears aloft, not seldom over
 the heads of men, over the crowns of kings, of emperors, and sometimes
 suffers to settle on the roofs of lofty palaces, and the summits
 of the tallest towers, whence if it fall, it cannot sink lower than the
 level from which it was raised. <milestone id="p04980041" />And if I ever devoted myself and
 all my powers to minister in any wise to your gratification, I am
 now minded more than ever so to do, because I know that there is
 nought that any can justly say in regard thereof, but that I, and
 others who love you, follow the promptings of nature, whose laws
 whoso would withstand, has need of powers pre-eminent, and, even
 so, will oft-times labour not merely in vain but to his own most
 grievous disadvantage. <milestone id="p04980042" />Such powers I own that I neither have, nor,
 to such end, desire to have; and had I them, I would rather leave
 them to another than use them myself. Wherefore let my detractors
 hold their peace, and if they cannot get heat, why, let them shiver
 their life away; and, while they remain addicted to their delights,
 <pb n="264" />or rather corrupt tastes, let them leave me to follow my own bent
 during the brief life that is accorded us. <milestone id="p04980043" />But this has been a long
 digression, fair ladies, and 'tis time to retrace our steps to the point
 where we deviated, and continue in the course on which we started.</p><p><milestone id="p04980044" />The sun had chased every star from the sky, and lifted the dank
 murk of night from the earth, when, Filostrato being risen, and
 having roused all his company, they hied them to the fair garden,
 and there fell to disporting themselves: the time for breakfast being
 come, they took it where they had supped on the preceding evening,
 <milestone id="p04980045" />and after they had slept they rose, when the sun was in his zenith,
 and seated themselves in their wonted manner by the beautiful
 fountain; where Fiammetta, being bidden by Filostrato to lead off
 the story-telling, awaited no second command, but debonairly thus
 began.</p></div2><pb n="265" /><div2 type="novella" who="fiammetta" id="nov0401"><head>Novel I</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04010001" />Tancred, Prince of Salerno, slays his daughter's lover,
 and sends her his heart in a golden cup: she pours
 upon it a poisonous distillation, which she drinks and
 dies.</p></argument><div3 who="fiammetta" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p04010002" />A direful theme has our king allotted us for to-day's discourse;
 seeing that, whereas we are here met for our common delectation,
 needs must we now tell of others' tears, whereby, whether telling
 or hearing, we cannot but be moved to pity. Perchance 'twas to
 temper in some degree the gaiety of the past days that he so
 ordained, but, whatever may have been his intent, his will must be
 to me immutable law; wherefore I will narrate to you a matter that
 befell piteously, nay woefully, and so as you may well weep thereat.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p04010003" />Tancred, Prince of Salerno, a lord most humane and kind of heart,
 but that in his old age he imbrued his hands in the blood of a lover,
 had in the whole course of his life but one daughter; and had he not
 had her, he had been more fortunate.</p><p><milestone id="p04010004" />Never was daughter more tenderly beloved of father than she of
 the Prince, who, for that cause not knowing how to part with her,
 kept her unmarried for many a year after she had come of marriageable
 age: then at last he gave her to a son of the Duke of Capua,
 with whom she had lived but a short while, when he died and she
      returned to her father. <milestone id="p04010005" />Most lovely was she of form and feature
 (never woman more so), and young and light of heart, and more
 knowing, perchance, than beseemed a woman. Dwelling thus with
 her loving father, as a great lady, in no small luxury, nor failing to
 see that the Prince, for the great love he bore her, was at no pains to
 provide her with another husband, and deeming it unseemly on her
 <pb n="266" />part to ask one of him, she cast about how she might come by a
 gallant to be her secret lover. <milestone id="p04010006" />And seeing at her father's court not
 a few men, both gentle and simple, that resorted thither, as we know
 men use to frequent courts, and closely scanning their mien and
 manners, she preferred before all others the Prince's page, Guiscardo
 by name, a man of very humble origin, but pre-eminent for native
 worth and noble bearing; of whom, seeing him frequently, she
 became hotly enamoured, hourly extolling his qualities more and
 more highly. The young man, who for all his youth by no means
 lacked shrewdness, read her heart, and gave her his own on such
 wise that his love for her engrossed his mind to the exclusion of
 almost everything else. <milestone id="p04010007" />While thus they burned in secret for one
 another, the lady, desiring of all things a meeting with Guiscardo,
 but being shy of making any her confidant, hit upon a novel
 expedient to concert the affair with him. She wrote him a letter
 containing her commands for the ensuing day, and thrust it into a
 cane in the space between two of the knots, which cane she gave to
 Guiscardo, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Thou canst let thy servant have it for a
 bellows to blow thy fire up to night.</q> 
<milestone id="p04010008" />Guiscardo took it, and
 feeling sure that 'twas not unadvisedly that she made him such a
 present, accompanied with such words, hied him straight home,
 where, carefully examining the cane, he observed that it was cleft,
 and, opening it, found the letter; which he had no sooner read, and
 learned what he was to do, than, pleased as ne'er another, he fell to
 devising how to set all in order that he might not fail to meet the
 lady on the following day, after the manner she had prescribed.</p><p><milestone id="p04010009" />Now hard by the Prince's palace was a grotto, hewn in days of
 old in the solid rock, and now long disused, so that an artificial
 orifice, by which it received a little light, was all but choked with
 brambles and plants that grew about and overspread it. From one
 of the ground-floor rooms of the palace, which room was part of the
 lady's suite, a secret stair led to the grotto, though the entrance was
 barred by a very strong door. <milestone id="p04010010" />This stair, having been from time
 immemorial disused, had passed out of mind so completely that there
 was scarce any that remembered that it was there: but Love, whose
 eyes nothing, however secret, may escape, had brought it to the mind
 of the enamoured lady. <milestone id="p04010011" />For many a day, using all secrecy, that
 none should discover her, she had wrought with her tools, until she had
 <pb n="267" />succeeded in opening the door; which done, she had gone down
 into the grotto alone, and having observed the orifice, had by her
 letter apprised Guiscardo of its apparent height above the floor of
 the grotto, and bidden him contrive some means of descending
 thereby. <milestone id="p04010012" />Eager to carry the affair through, Guiscardo lost no time
 in rigging up a ladder of ropes, whereby he might ascend and
 descend; and having put on a suit of leather to protect him from
 the brambles, he hied him the following night (keeping the affair
 close from all) to the orifice, made the ladder fast by one of its ends
 to a massive trunk that was rooted in the mouth of the orifice,
 climbed down the ladder, and awaited the lady. <milestone id="p04010013" />On the morrow,
 making as if she would fain sleep, the lady dismissed her damsels,
 and locked herself into her room: she then opened the door of the
 grotto, hied her down, and met Guiscardo, to their marvellous
 mutual satisfaction. The lovers then repaired to her room, where
 in exceeding great joyance they spent no small part of the day. 
<milestone id="p04010014" />Nor
 were they neglectful of the precautions needful to prevent discovery
 of their amour; but in due time Guiscardo returned to the grotto;
 whereupon the lady locked the door and rejoined her damsels. At
 nightfall Guiscardo reascended his ladder, and, issuing forth of the
 orifice, hied him home; nor, knowing now the way, did he fail to
 revisit the grotto many a time thereafter.</p><p><milestone id="p04010015" />But Fortune, noting with envious eye a happiness of such degree
 and duration, gave to events a dolorous turn, whereby the joy of the
 two lovers was converted into bitter lamentation. <milestone id="p04010016" />'Twas Tancred's
 custom to come from time to time quite alone to his daughter's
 room, and tarry talking with her a while. <milestone id="p04010017" />Whereby it so befell that
 he came down there one day after breakfast, while Ghismonda--such
 was the lady's name--was in her garden with her damsels; so that
 none saw or heard him enter; nor would he call his daughter, for he
 was minded that she should not forgo her pleasure. But, finding the
 windows closed and the bed-curtains drawn down, he seated himself
 on a divan that stood at one of the corners of the bed, rested his head
 on the bed, drew the curtain over him, and thus, hidden as if of set
 purpose, fell asleep. <milestone id="p04010018" />As he slept Ghismonda, who, as it happened,
 had caused Guiscardo to come that day, left her damsels in the garden,
 softly entered the room, and having locked herself in, unwitting
 that there was another in the room, opened the door to Guiscardo,
 <pb n="268" />who was in waiting. Straightway they got them to bed, as was
 their wont; and, while they there solaced and disported them
 together, it so befell that Tancred awoke, and heard and saw what
 they did: <milestone id="p04010019" />whereat he was troubled beyond measure, and at first was
 minded to upbraid them; but on second thoughts he deemed it best
 to hold his peace, and avoid discovery, if so he might with greater
 stealth and less dishonour carry out the design which was already in
 his mind. <milestone id="p04010020" />The two lovers continued long together, as they were
 wont, all unwitting of Tancred; but at length they saw fit to get
 out of bed, when Guiscardo went back to the grotto, and the lady
 hied her forth of the room. <milestone id="p04010021" />Whereupon Tancred, old though he
 was, got out at one of the windows, clambered down into the garden,
 and, seen by none, returned sorely troubled to his room. <milestone id="p04010022" />By his
 command two men took Guiscardo early that same night, as he
 issued forth of the orifice accoutred in his suit of leather, and brought
 him privily to Tancred; who, as he saw him, all but wept, and
 said: <q direct="unspecified">Guiscardo, my kindness to thee is ill requited by the outrage
 and dishonour which thou hast done me in the person of my daughter,
 as to-day I have seen with my own eyes.</q> 
<milestone id="p04010023" />To whom Guiscardo
 could answer nought but: <q direct="unspecified">Love is more potent than either you
 or I.</q> 
<milestone id="p04010024" />Tancred then gave order to keep him privily under watch
 and ward in a room within the palace; and so 'twas done. 
<milestone id="p04010025" />Next
 day, while Ghismonda wotted nought of these matters, Tancred,
 after pondering divers novel expedients, hied him after breakfast,
 according to his wont, to his daughter's room, where, having called
 her to him and locked himself in with her, he began, not without
 tears, to speak on this wise: 
<milestone id="p04010026" /><q direct="unspecified">Ghismonda, conceiving that I knew
 thy virtue and honour, never, though it had been reported to me,
 would I have credited, had I not seen with my own eyes, that thou
 wouldst so much as in idea, not to say fact, have ever yielded thyself
 to any man but thy husband: wherefore, for the brief residue of life
 that my age has in store for me, the memory of thy fall will ever be
 grievous to me. <milestone id="p04010027" />And would to God, as thou must needs demean
 thyself to such dishonour, thou hadst taken a man that matched thy
 nobility; but of all the men that frequent my court, thou must needs
 choose Guiscardo, a young man of the lowest condition, a fellow
 whom we brought up in charity from his tender years; for whose
 sake thou hast plunged me into the abyss of mental tribulation,
 <pb n="269" />insomuch that I know not what course to take in regard of thee.
 <milestone id="p04010028" />As to Guiscardo, whom I caused to be arrested last night as he
 issued from the orifice, and keep in durance, my course is already
 taken, but how I am to deal with thee, God knows, I know not. 
<milestone id="p04010029" />I
 am distraught between the love which I have ever borne thee, love
 such as no father ever bare to daughter, and the most just indignation
 evoked in me by thy signal folly; my love prompts me to pardon
 thee, my indignation bids me harden my heart against thee, though
 I do violence to my nature. But before I decide upon my course,
 I would fain hear what thou hast to say to this.</q> So saying, he
 bent his head, and wept as bitterly as any child that had been
 soundly thrashed.</p><p><milestone id="p04010030" />Her father's words, and the tidings they conveyed that not only
 was her secret passion discovered, but Guiscardo taken, caused
 Ghismonda immeasurable grief, which she was again and again on
 the point of evincing, as most women do, by cries and tears; but
 her high spirit triumphed over this weakness; by a prodigious effort
 she composed her countenance, and taking it for granted that her
 Guiscardo was no more, she inly devoted herself to death rather than
 a single prayer for herself should escape her lips. 
<milestone id="p04010031" />Wherefore, not as
 a woman stricken with grief or chidden for a fault, but unconcerned
 and unabashed, with tearless eyes, and frank and utterly dauntless
 mien, thus answered she her father: <q direct="unspecified">Tancred, your accusation
 I shall not deny, neither will I cry you mercy, for nought should
 I gain by denial, nor aught would I gain by supplication: nay more;
 there is nought I will do to conciliate thy humanity and love; my
 only care is to confess the truth, to defend my honour by words of
 sound reason, and then by deeds most resolute to give effect to the
 promptings of my high soul. 
<milestone id="p04010032" />True it is that I have loved and love
 Guiscardo, and during the brief while I have yet to live shall love
 him, nor after death, so there be then love, shall I cease to love him;
 but that I love him, is not imputable to my womanly frailty so
 much as to the little zeal thou shewedst for my bestowal in marriage,
 and to Guiscardo's own worth. <milestone id="p04010033" />It should not have escaped thee,
 Tancred, creature of flesh and blood as thou art, that thy daughter
 was also a creature of flesh and blood, and not of stone or iron; it
 was, and is, thy duty to bear in mind (old though thou art) the
 nature and the might of the laws to which youth is subject; and,
 <pb n="270" />though thou hast spent part of thy best years in martial exercises,
 thou shouldst nevertheless have not been ignorant how potent is the
 influence even upon the aged--to say nothing of the young--of ease
 and luxury. <milestone id="p04010034" />And not only am I, as being thy daughter, a creature
 of flesh and blood, but my life is not so far spent but that I am still
 young, and thus doubly fraught with fleshly appetite, the vehemence
 whereof is marvellously enhanced by reason that, having been married,
 I have known the pleasure that ensues upon the satisfaction of such
 desire. <milestone id="p04010035" />Which forces being powerless to withstand, I did but act
 as was natural in a young woman, when I gave way to them, and
 yielded myself to love. Nor in sooth did I fail to the utmost of my
 power so to order the indulgence of my natural propensity that my
 sin should bring shame neither upon thee nor upon me. <milestone id="p04010036" />To which
 end Love in his pity, and Fortune in a friendly mood, found and
 discovered to me a secret way, whereby, none witting, I attained my
 desire: this, from whomsoever thou hast learned it, howsoever thou
 comest to know it, I deny not. <milestone id="p04010037" />'Twas not at random, as many
 women do, that I loved Guiscardo; but by deliberate choice I preferred
 him before all other men, and of determinate forethought I
 lured him to my love, whereof, through his and my discretion and
 constancy, I have long had joyance. <milestone id="p04010038" />Wherein 'twould seem that
 thou, following rather the opinion of the vulgar than the dictates of
 truth, find cause to chide me more severely than in my sinful love,
 for, as if thou wouldst not have been vexed, had my choice fallen on
 a nobleman, thou complainest that I have forgathered with a man of
 low condition; and dost not see that therein thou censurest not my
 fault but that of Fortune, which not seldom raises the unworthy to
 high place and leaves the worthiest in low estate. <milestone id="p04010039" />But leave we
 this: consider a little the principles of things: thou seest that in
 regard of our flesh we are all moulded of the same substance, and
 that all souls are endowed by one and the same Creator with equal
 faculties, equal powers, equal virtues. <milestone id="p04010040" />'Twas merit that made the
 first distinction between us, born as we were, nay, as we are, all
 equal, and those whose merits were and were approved in act the
 greatest were called noble, and the rest were not so denoted. Which
 law, albeit overlaid by the contrary usage of after times, is not yet
 abrogated, nor so impaired but that it is still traceable in nature and
 good manners; for which cause whoso with merit acts, does plainly
 <pb n="271" />shew himself a gentleman; and if any denote him otherwise, the
 default is his own and not his whom he so denotes. <milestone id="p04010041" />Pass in review
 all thy nobles, weigh their merits, their manners and bearing, and then
 compare Guiscardo's qualities with theirs: if thou wilt judge without
 prejudice, thou wilt pronounce him noble in the highest degree, and
 thy nobles one and all churls. As to Guiscardo's merits and worth I
 did but trust the verdict which thou thyself didst utter in words, and
 which mine own eyes confirmed. <milestone id="p04010042" />Of whom had he such commendation
 as of thee for all those excellences whereby a good man and true
 merits commendation? And in sooth thou didst him but justice;
 for, unless mine eyes have played me false, there was nought for
 which thou didst commend him but I had seen him practise it, and
 that more admirably than words of thine might express; and had I
 been at all deceived in this matter, 'twould have been by thee. Wilt
 thou say then that I have forgathered with a man of low condition?
 If so, thou wilt not say true. <milestone id="p04010043" />Didst thou say with a poor man, the
 impeachment might be allowed, to thy shame, that thou so ill hast
 known how to requite a good man and true that is thy servant; but
 poverty, though it take away all else, deprives no man of gentilesse.
 Many kings, many great princes, were once poor, and many a ditcher
 or herdsman has been and is very wealthy. <milestone id="p04010044" />As for thy last perpended
 doubt, to wit, how thou shouldst deal with me, banish it
 utterly from thy thoughts. If in thy extreme old age thou art
 minded to manifest a harshness unwonted in thy youth, wreak thy
 harshness on me, resolved as I am to cry thee no mercy, prime cause
 as I am that this sin, if sin it be, has been committed; for of this I
 warrant thee, that as thou mayst have done or shalt do to Guiscardo,
 if to me thou do not the like, I with my own hands will do it. <milestone id="p04010045" />Now
 get thee gone to shed thy tears with the women, and when thy
 melting mood is over, ruthlessly destroy Guiscardo and me, if such
 thou deem our merited doom, by one and the same blow.</q></p><p><milestone id="p04010046" />The loftiness of his daughter's spirit was not unknown to the
 Prince; but still he did not credit her with a resolve quite as firmly
 fixed as her words implied, to carry their purport into effect. So,
 parting from her without the least intention of using harshness
 towards her in her own person, he determined to quench the heat of
 her love by wreaking his vengeance on her lover, and bade the two
 men that had charge of Guiscardo to strangle him noiselessly that
 <pb n="272" />same night, take the heart out of the body, and send it to him. 
<milestone id="p04010047" />The
 men did his bidding: and on the morrow the Prince had a large and
 beautiful cup of gold brought to him, and having put Guiscardo's
 heart therein, sent it by the hand of one of his most trusted servants
 to his daughter, charging the servant to say, as he gave it to her:
 <q direct="unspecified">Thy father sends thee this to give thee joy of that which thou
 lovest best, even as thou hast given him joy of that which he loved
 best.</q></p><p><milestone id="p04010048" />Now when her father had left her, Ghismonda, wavering not
 a jot in her stern resolve, had sent for poisonous herbs and roots, and
 therefrom had distilled a water, to have it ready for use, if that which
 she apprehended should come to pass. <milestone id="p04010049" />And when the servant
 appeared with the Prince's present and message, she took the cup
 unblenchingly, and having lifted the lid, and seen the heart, and
 apprehended the meaning of the words, and that the heart was
 beyond a doubt Guiscardo's, she raised her head, and looking straight
 at the servant, said: <q direct="unspecified">Sepulture less honourable than of gold had
 ill befitted heart such as this: herein has my father done wisely.</q>
 <milestone id="p04010050" />Which said, she raised it to her lips, and kissed it, saying: <q direct="unspecified">In all
 things and at all times, even to this last hour of my life, have I
 found my father most tender in his love, but now more so than
 ever before; wherefore I now render him the last thanks which will
 ever be due from me to him for this goodly present.</q> 
<milestone id="p04010051" />So she spoke,
 and straining the cup to her, bowed her head over it, and gazing at
 the heart, said: <q direct="unspecified">Ah! sojourn most sweet of all my joys, accursed
 be he by whose ruthless act I see thee with the bodily eye: 'twas
 enough that to the mind's eye thou wert hourly present. 
<milestone id="p04010052" />Thou
 hast run thy course; thou hast closed the span that Fortune allotted
 thee; thou hast reached the goal of all; thou hast left behind thee
 the woes and weariness of the world; and thy enemy has himself
 granted thee sepulture accordant with thy deserts. 
<milestone id="p04010053" />No circumstance
 was wanting to duly celebrate thy obsequies, save the tears of her
 whom, while thou livedst, thou didst so dearly love; which that
 thou shouldst not lack, my remorseless father was prompted of God
 to send thee to me, and, albeit my resolve was fixed to die with eyes
 unmoistened and front all unperturbed by fear, yet will I accord
 thee my tears; which done, my care shall be forthwith by thy
 means to join my soul to that most precious soul which thou didst
 <pb n="273" />once enshrine. 
<milestone id="p04010054" />And is there other company than hers, in which
 with more of joy and peace I might fare to the abodes unknown?
 She is yet here within, I doubt not, contemplating the abodes of her
 and my delights, and--for sure I am that she loves me--awaiting my
 soul that loves her before all else.</q></p><p><milestone id="p04010055" />Having thus spoken, she bowed herself low over the cup; and,
 while no womanish cry escaped her, 'twas as if a fountain of water
 were unloosed within her head, so wondrous a flood of tears gushed
 from her eyes, while times without number she kissed the dead
 heart. <milestone id="p04010056" />Her damsels that stood around her knew not whose the
 heart might be or what her words might mean, but melting in sympathy,
 they all wept, and compassionately, as vainly, enquired the
 cause of her lamentation, and in many other ways sought to comfort
 her to the best of their understanding and power. 
<milestone id="p04010057" />When she had
 wept her fill, she raised her head, and dried her eyes. Then: <q direct="unspecified">O
 heart,</q> said she, <q direct="unspecified">much cherished heart, discharged is my every duty
 towards thee; nought now remains for me to do but to come and
 unite my soul with thine.</q> 
<milestone id="p04010058" />So saying, she sent for the vase that
 held the water which the day before she had distilled, and emptied
 it into the cup where lay the heart bathed in her tears; then, nowise
 afraid, she set her mouth to the cup, and drained it dry, and so with
 the cup in her hand she got her upon her bed, and having there disposed
 her person in guise as seemly as she might, laid her dead lover's heart
 upon her own, and silently awaited death. 
<milestone id="p04010059" />Meanwhile the damsels,
 seeing and hearing what passed, but knowing not what the water
 was that she had drunk, had sent word of each particular to Tancred;
 who, apprehensive of that which came to pass, came down with all
 haste to his daughter's room, where he arrived just as she got her
 upon her bed, and, now too late, addressed himself to comfort her
 with soft words, and seeing in what plight she was, burst into a flood
 of bitter tears. <milestone id="p04010060" />To whom the lady: <q direct="unspecified">Reserve thy tears, Tancred,
 till Fortune send thee hap less longed for than this: waste them not
 on me who care not for them. Whoever yet saw any but thee
 bewail the consummation of his desire? But, if of the love thou
 once didst bear me any spark still lives in thee, be it thy parting
 grace to me, that, as thou brookedst not that I should live with
 Guiscardo in privity and seclusion, so wherever thou mayst have
 caused Guiscardo's body to be cast, mine may be united with it in the
 <pb n="274" />common view of all.</q> 
<milestone id="p04010061" />The Prince replied not for excess of grief;
 and the lady, feeling that her end was come, strained the dead heart
 to her bosom, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Fare ye well; I take my leave of you;</q>
 and with eyelids drooped and every sense evanished departed this
 life of woe. 
<milestone id="p04010062" />Such was the lamentable end of the loves of Guiscardo
 and Ghismonda; whom Tancred, tardily repentant of his harshness,
 mourned not a little, as did also all the folk of Salerno, and had
 honourably interred side by side in the same tomb.</p></div2><pb n="275" /><div2 type="novella" who="pampinea" id="nov0402"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04020001" />Fra Alberto gives a lady to under stand that she is beloved

	than once had Fiammetta's story brought tears to the eyes of her fair companions; but now
	that it was ended the king said with an austere air: <q direct="unspecified">I should esteem my life but a

	began:</p></div3><div3 who="pampinea" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p04020005" />'Tis a proverb current among the vulgar, that: <q direct="unspecified">Whoso, being

 discourse, germane to our theme, besides occasion to exhibit the
 quality and degree of the hypocrisy of the religious, who flaunt it in
 ample flowing robes, and, with faces made pallid by art, with voices
 low and gentle to beg alms, most loud and haughty to reprove in
 others their own sins, would make believe that their way of salvation
 lies in taking from us and ours in giving to them; <milestone id="p04020006" />nay, more, as if
 they had not like us Paradise to win, but were already its lords and

 according to the amount of the money that he has bequeathed to
 them; which if they believe, 'tis by dint of self-delusion, and to the
 effect of deluding all that put faith in their words. 
<milestone id="p04020007" />Of whose guile
 were it lawful for me to make as full exposure as were fitting, not a
 few simple folk should soon be enlightened as to what they cloak
 within the folds of their voluminous habits. But would to God all
 might have the like reward of their lies as a certain friar minor, no
 novice, but one that was reputed among their greatest<note>de' maggior

 suggested.</note> at Venice;
 whose story, rather than aught else, I am minded to tell you, if so
 I may, perchance, by laughter and jollity relieve in some degree your
 souls that are heavy laden with pity for the death of Ghismonda.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p04020008" />Know then, noble ladies, that there was in Imola a man of evil
 and corrupt life, Berto della Massa by name, whose pestilent practices
 came at length to be so well known to the good folk of Imola that
 'twas all one whether he lied or spoke the truth, for there was not a
 soul in Imola that believed a word he said: wherefore, seeing that his
 tricks would pass no longer there, he removed, as in despair, to Venice,
 that common sink of all abominations, thinking there to find other
 means than he had found elsewhere to the prosecution of his nefarious
 designs. <milestone id="p04020009" />And, as if conscience-stricken for his past misdeeds, he
 assumed an air of the deepest humility, turned the best Catholic of
 them all, and went and made himself a friar minor, taking the name
 of Fra Alberto da Imola. With his habit he put on a shew of
 austerity, highly commending penitence and abstinence, and eating
 or drinking no sort of meat or wine but such as was to his taste.
 <pb n="277" />
<milestone id="p04020010" />And scarce a soul was there that wist that the thief, the pimp,
 the cheat, the assassin, had not been suddenly converted into a great
 preacher without continuing in the practice of the said iniquities,
 whensoever the same was privily possible. And withal, having got
 himself made priest, as often as he celebrated at the altar, he would
 weep over the passion of our Lord, so there were folk in plenty to
 see, for tears cost him little enough, when he had a mind to shed
 them. <milestone id="p04020011" />In short, what with his sermons and his tears, he duped the
 folk of Venice to such a tune that scarce a will was there made but
 he was its executor and depositary; nay, not a few made him trustee
 of their moneys, and most, or well-nigh most, men and women alike,
 their confessor and counsellor: in short, he had put off the wolf and
 put on the shepherd, and the fame of his holiness was such in those
 parts that St. Francis himself had never the like at Assisi.</p><p><milestone id="p04020012" />Now it so befell that among the ladies that came to confess to this
 holy friar was one Monna Lisetta of Ca' Quirino, the young, silly,
 empty-headed wife of a great merchant, who was gone with the
 galleys to Flanders. Like a Venetian--for unstable are they all--though
 she placed herself at his feet, she told him but a part of her
 sins, and when Fra Alberto asked her whether she had a lover, 
<milestone id="p04020013" />she
 replied with black looks: <q direct="unspecified">How now, master friar? have you not
 eyes in your head? See you no difference between my charms and
 those of other women? Lovers in plenty might I have, so I would:
 but charms such as mine must not be cheapened: 'tis not every man
 that might presume to love me. How many ladies have you seen
 whose beauty is comparable to mine? I should adorn Paradise
 itself.</q> Whereto she added so much more in praise of her beauty
 that the friar could scarce hear her with patience. 
<milestone id="p04020014" />Howbeit, discerning
 at a glance that she was none too well furnished with sense,
 he deemed the soil meet for his plough, and fell forthwith inordinately
 in love with her, though he deferred his blandishments to a more
 convenient season, and by way of supporting his character for holiness
 began instead to chide her, telling her (among other novelties) that
 this was vainglory: whereto the lady retorted that he was a blockhead,
 and could not distinguish one degree of beauty from another.
 Wherefore Fra Alberto, lest he should occasion her too much chagrin,
 cut short the confession, and suffered her to depart with the other
 ladies. 
<milestone id="p04020015" />Some days after, accompanied by a single trusty friend, he
 <pb n="278" />hied him to Monna Lisetta's house, and having withdrawn with her
 alone into a saloon, where they were safe from observation, he fell on
 his knees at her feet, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, for the love of God I
 crave your pardon of that which I said to you on Sunday, when you
 spoke to me of your beauty, for so grievously was I chastised therefor
 that very night, that 'tis but to-day that I have been able to quit
 my bed.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020016" /><q direct="unspecified">And by whom,</q> quoth my Lady Battledore, <q direct="unspecified">were
 you so chastised?</q> 
<milestone id="p04020017" /><q direct="unspecified">I will tell you,</q> returned Fra Alberto.
 <q direct="unspecified">That night I was, as is ever my wont, at my orisons, when suddenly
 a great light shone in my cell, and before I could turn me
 to see what it was, I saw standing over me a right goodly youth with
 a stout cudgel in his hand, who seized me by the habit and threw
 me at his feet and belaboured me till I was bruised from head to
 foot. <milestone id="p04020018" />And when I asked him why he used me thus, he answered:
 --''Tis because thou didst to-day presume to speak slightingly of
 the celestial charms of Monna Lisetta, whom I love next to God
 Himself.' <milestone id="p04020019" />Whereupon I asked: 'And who are you?' And he
 made answer that he was the Angel Gabriel. Then said I: 'O
 my lord, I pray you pardon me.' Whereto he answered: 'I pardon
 thee on condition that thou go to her, with what speed thou mayst,
 and obtain her pardon, which if she accord thee not, I shall come
 back hither and give thee belabourings enough with my cudgel to
 make thee a sad man for the rest of thy days.' What more he
 said, I dare not tell you, unless you first pardon me.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020020" />Whereat our
 flimsy pumpion-pated Lady Lackbrain was overjoyed, taking all the
 friar's words for gospel. So after a while she said: <q direct="unspecified">And did I not
 tell you, Fra Alberto, that my charms were celestial? But, so help
 me God, I am moved to pity of you, and forthwith I pardon you,
 lest worse should befall you, so only you tell me what more the
 Angel said.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020021" /><q direct="unspecified">So will I gladly, Madam,</q> returned Fra Alberto,
 <q direct="unspecified">now that I have your pardon; this only I bid you bear in mind,
 that you have a care that never a soul in the world hear from you a
 single word of what I shall say to you, if you would not spoil your
 good fortune, wherein there is not to-day in the whole world a lady
 that may compare with you. <milestone id="p04020022" />Know then that the Angel Gabriel
 bade me tell you that you stand so high in his favour that again and
 again he would have come to pass the night with you, but that he
 doubted he should affright you. <milestone id="p04020023" />So now he sends you word through
 <pb n="279" />me that he would fain come one night, and stay a while with you;
 and seeing that, being an angel, if he should visit you in his angelic
 shape, he might not be touched by you, he would, to pleasure you,
 present himself in human shape; and so he bids you send him word,
 when you would have him come, and in whose shape, and he will
 come; for which cause you may deem yourself more blessed than
 any other lady that lives.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020024" />My Lady Vanity then said that she
 was highly flattered to be beloved of the Angel Gabriel; whom she
 herself loved so well that she had never grudged four soldi to burn
 a candle before his picture, wherever she saw it, and that he was
 welcome to visit her as often as he liked, and would always find her
 alone in her room; <milestone id="p04020025" />on the understanding, however, that he should
 not desert her for the Virgin Mary, whom she had heard he did
 mightily affect, and indeed 'twould so appear, for, wherever she saw
 him, he was always on his knees at her feet: for the rest he might
 even come in what shape he pleased, so that it was not such as to
 terrify her. <milestone id="p04020026" />Then said Fra Alberto: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, 'tis wisely spoken;
 and I will arrange it all with him just as you say. But 'tis in your
 power to do me a great favour, which will cost you nothing; and
 this favour is that you be consenting that he visit you in my
 shape. Now hear wherein you will confer this favour: thus will it
 be: he will disembody my soul, and set it in Paradise, entering himself
 into my body; and, as long as he shall be with you, my soul will
 be in Paradise.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020027" />Whereto my Lady Slenderwit: <q direct="unspecified">So be it,</q> she
 said; <q direct="unspecified">I am well pleased that you have this solace to salve the bruises
 that he gives you on my account.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020028" /><q direct="unspecified">Good,</q> said Fra Alberto;
 <q direct="unspecified">then you will see to it that to-night he find, when he comes, your
 outer door unlatched, that he may have ingress; for, coming, as he
 will, in human shape, he will not be able to enter save by the door.</q>
 <milestone id="p04020029" /><q direct="unspecified">It shall be done,</q> replied the lady. Whereupon Fra Alberto took
 his leave, and the lady remained in such a state of exaltation that her
 nether end knew not her chemise, and it seemed to her a thousand
 years until the Angel Gabriel should come to visit her. 
<milestone id="p04020030" />Fra
 Alberto, bethinking him that 'twas not as an angel, but as a cavalier
 that he must acquit himself that night, fell to fortifying himself with
 comfits and other dainties, that he might not lose his saddle for
 slight cause. Then, leave of absence gotten, he betook him at nightfall,
 with a single companion, to the house of a woman that was his
 <pb n="280" />friend, which house had served on former occasions as his base when
 he went a chasing the fillies; and having there disguised himself,
 he hied him, when he deemed 'twas time, to the house of the lady,
 where, donning the gewgaws he had brought with him, he transformed
 himself into an angel, and going up, entered the lady's
 chamber. <milestone id="p04020031" />No sooner saw she this dazzling apparition than she fell
 on her knees before the Angel, who gave her his blessing, raised her
 to her feet, and motioned her to go to bed. She, nothing loath,
 obeyed forthwith, and the Angel lay down beside his devotee. 
<milestone id="p04020032" />Now
 Fra Alberto was a stout, handsome fellow, whose legs bore themselves
 right bravely; and being bedded with Monna Lisetta, who was lusty
 and delicate, he covered her after another fashion than her husband
 had been wont, and took many a flight that night without wings, so
 that she heartily cried him content; and not a little therewithal did
 he tell her of the glory celestial. <milestone id="p04020033" />Then towards daybreak, all being
 ready for his return, he hied him forth, and repaired, caparisoned as
 he was, to his friend, whom, lest he should be affrighted, sleeping
 alone, the good woman of the house had solaced with her company.
 <milestone id="p04020034" />The lady, so soon as she had breakfasted, betook her to Fra Alberto,
 and reported the Angel Gabriel's visit, and what he had told her of
 the glory of the life eternal, describing his appearance, not without
 some added marvels of her own invention. 
<milestone id="p04020035" />Whereto Fra Alberto
 replied: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, I know not how you fared with him; but this
 I know, that last night he came to me, and for that I had done his
 errand with you, he suddenly transported my soul among such a
 multitude of flowers and roses as was never seen here below, and my
 soul--what became of my body I know not--tarried in one of the
 most delightful places that ever was from that hour until matins.</q>
 <milestone id="p04020036" /><q direct="unspecified">As for your body,</q> said the lady, <q direct="unspecified">do I not tell you whose it was?
 It lay all night long with the Angel Gabriel in my arms; and if you
 believe me not, you have but to look under your left pap, where I
 gave the Angel a mighty kiss, of which the mark will last for some
 days.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020037" /><q direct="unspecified">Why then,</q> said Fra Alberto, <q direct="unspecified">I will even do to-day
 what 'tis long since I did, to wit, undress, that I may see if you say
 sooth.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020038" />So they fooled it a long while, and then the lady went
 home, where Fra Alberto afterwards paid her many a visit without
 any let. 
<milestone id="p04020039" />However, one day it so befell that while Monna Lisetta
 was with one of her gossips canvassing beauties, she, being minded
 <pb n="281" />to exalt her own charms above all others, and having, as we know,
 none too much wit in her pumpion-pate, observed: <q direct="unspecified">Did you but
 know by whom my charms are prized, then, for sure, you would
 have nought to say of the rest.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020040" />Her gossip, all agog to hear, for
 well she knew her foible, answered: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, it may be as you say,
 but still, while one knows not who he may be, one cannot alter one's
 mind so rapidly.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020041" />Whereupon my Lady Featherbrain: <q direct="unspecified">Gossip,</q>
 said she, <q direct="unspecified">'tis not for common talk, but he that I wot of is the
 Angel Gabriel, who loves me more dearly than himself, for that I
 am, so he tells me, the fairest lady in all the world, ay, and in the
 Maremma to boot.</q><note>With this ineptitude cf. the friar's <q direct="unspecified">flowers
 and roses</q> on the preceding
 page.</note> 
<milestone id="p04020042" />Whereat her gossip would fain have laughed,
 but held herself in, being minded to hear more from her. Wherefore
 she said: <q direct="unspecified">God's faith, Madam, if 'tis the Angel Gabriel, and
 he tells you so, why, so of course it must needs be; but I wist
 not the angels meddled with such matters.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020043" /><q direct="unspecified">There you erred,
 gossip,</q> said the lady: <q direct="unspecified">zounds, he does it better than my husband,
 and he tells me they do it above there too, but, as he rates my
 charms above any that are in heaven, he is enamoured of me, and
 not seldom visits me: so now dost see?</q> 
<milestone id="p04020044" />So away went the gossip
 so agog to tell the story, that it seemed to her a thousand years till
 she was where it might be done; and being met for recreation with
 a great company of ladies, she narrated it all in detail: whereby it
 passed to the ladies' husbands, and to other ladies, and from them to
 yet other ladies, so that in less than two days all Venice was full of
 it. But among others, whose ears it reached, were Monna Lisetta's
 brothers-in-law, who, keeping their own counsel, resolved to find
 this angel and make out whether he knew how to fly; to which end
 they kept watch for some nights. 
<milestone id="p04020045" />Whereof no hint, as it happened,
 reached Fra Alberto's ears; and so, one night when he was come to
 enjoy the lady once more, he was scarce undressed when her brothers-in-law,
 who had seen him come, were at the door of the room and
 already opening it, when Fra Alberto, hearing the noise and apprehending
 the danger, started up, and having no other resource, threw open
 a window that looked on to the Grand Canal, and plunged into the
 water. <milestone id="p04020046" />The depth was great, and he was an expert swimmer; so
 that he took no hurt, but, having reached the other bank, found a
 <pb n="282" />house open, and forthwith entered it, praying the good man that was
 within, for God's sake to save his life, and trumping up a story to
 account for his being there at so late an hour, and stripped to the
 skin. The good man took pity on him, and having occasion to go
 out, he put him in his own bed, bidding him stay there until his
 return; and so, having locked him in, he went about his business.</p><p><milestone id="p04020047" />Now when the lady's brothers-in-law entered the room, and found
 that the Angel Gabriel had taken flight, leaving his wings behind him,
 being baulked of their prey, they roundly rated the lady, and then,
 leaving her disconsolate, betook themselves home with the Angel's
 spoils. <milestone id="p04020048" />Whereby it befell, that, when 'twas broad day, the good man,
 being on the Rialto, heard tell how the Angel Gabriel had come to
 pass the night with Monna Lisetta, and, being surprised by her
 brothers-in-law, had taken fright, and thrown himself into the Canal,
 and none knew what was become of him. The good man guessed
 in a trice that the said Angel was no other than the man he had at
 home, whom on his return he recognized, and, after much chaffering,
 brought him to promise him fifty ducats that he might not be given
 up to the lady's brothers-in-law. <milestone id="p04020049" />The bargain struck, Fra Alberto
 signified a desire to be going. Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">There is no way,</q>
 said the good man, <q direct="unspecified">but one, if you are minded to take it. To-day
 we hold a revel, wherein folk lead others about in various disguises;
 as, one man will present a bear, another a wild man, and so forth;
 and then in the piazza of San Marco there is a hunt, which done, the
 revel is ended; and then away they hie them, whither they will, each
 with the man he has led about. <milestone id="p04020050" />If you are willing to be led by me
 in one or another of these disguises, before it can get wind that you
 are here, I can bring you whither you would go; otherwise I see not
 how you are to quit this place without being known; and the lady's
 brothers-in-law, reckoning that you must be lurking somewhere in this
 quarter, have set guards all about to take you.</q> 
<milestone id="p04020051" />Loath indeed was Fra
 Alberto to go in such a guise, but such was his fear of the lady's relations
 that he consented, and told the good man whither he desired to be
 taken, and that he was content to leave the choice of the disguise
 to him. <milestone id="p04020052" />The good man then smeared him all over with honey, and
 covered him with down, set a chain on his neck and a vizard on
 his face, gave him a stout cudgel to carry in one hand, and two
 huge dogs, which he had brought from the shambles, to lead with
 <pb n="283" />the other, and sent a man to the Rialto to announce that whoso would
 see the Angel Gabriel should hie him to the piazza of San Marco; in
 all which he acted as a leal Venetian. <milestone id="p04020053" />And so, after a while, he led
 him forth, and then, making him go before, held him by the chain
 behind, and through a great throng that clamoured: <q direct="unspecified">What manner
 of thing is this? what manner of thing is this?</q> he brought him
 to the piazza, where, what with those that followed them, and those
 that had come from the Rialto on hearing the announcement, there
 were folk without end. <milestone id="p04020054" />Arrived at the piazza, he fastened his wild
 man to a column in a high and exposed place, making as if he were
 minded to wait till the hunt should begin; whereby the flies and
 gadflies, attracted by the honey with which he was smeared, caused
 him most grievous distress. <milestone id="p04020055" />However, the good man waited only
 until the piazza was thronged, and then, making as if he would
 unchain his wild man, he tore the vizard from Fra Alberto's face,
 saying: <q direct="unspecified">Gentlemen, as the boar comes not to the hunt, and the hunt
 does not take place, that it be not for nothing that you are come hither,
 I am minded to give you a view of the Angel Gabriel, who comes
 down from heaven to earth by night to solace the ladies of Venice.</q>
 <milestone id="p04020056" />The vizard was no sooner withdrawn than all recognized Fra Alberto,
 and greeted him with hootings, rating him in language as offensive
 and opprobrious as ever rogue was abused withal, and pelting him in
 the face with every sort of filth that came to hand: <milestone id="p04020057" />in which plight
 they kept him an exceeding great while, until by chance the bruit
 thereof reached his brethren, of whom some six thereupon put themselves
 in motion, and, arrived at the piazza, clapped a habit on his
 back, and unchained him, and amid an immense uproar led him off
 to their convent, where, after languishing a while in prison, 'tis believed
 that he died.</p><p><milestone id="p04020058" />So this man, by reason that, being reputed righteous, he did evil,
 and 'twas not imputed to him, presumed to counterfeit the Angel
 Gabriel, and, being transformed into a wild man, was in the end put
 to shame, as he deserved, and vainly bewailed his misdeeds. God
 grant that so it may betide all his likes.</p></div2><pb n="284" /><div2 type="novella" who="lauretta" id="nov0403"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04030001" />Three young men love three sisters, and flee with them to

	there is no vice but most grievous disaster may ensue thereon to him
	that practises it, and not seldom to others; and of all the vices that
	which hurries us into peril with loosest rein is, methinks, anger;
	which is nought but a rash and hasty impulse, prompted by a feeling
	of pain, which banishes reason, shrouds the eyes of the mind in thick
	darkness, and sets the soul ablaze with a fierce frenzy. 
	<milestone id="p04030005" />Which,
	<pb n="285" />though it not seldom befall men, and one rather than another, has
	nevertheless been observed to be fraught in women with more
	disastrous consequences, inasmuch as in them the flame is both more
	readily kindled, and burns more brightly, and with less impediment
	to its vehemence. <milestone id="p04030006" />Wherein is no cause to marvel, for, if we consider
	it, we shall see that 'tis of the nature of fire to lay hold more readily
	of things light and delicate than of matters of firmer and more solid
	substance; and sure it is that we (without offence to the men be it
	spoken) are more delicate than they, and much more mobile. 
	<milestone id="p04030007" />Wherefore,
	seeing how prone we are thereto by nature, and considering
	also our gentleness and tenderness, how soothing and consolatory they
	are to the men with whom we consort, and that thus this madness
	of wrath is fraught with grievous annoy and peril; therefore, that
	with stouter heart we may defend ourselves against it, I purpose by
	my story to shew you, how the loves of three young men, and as
	many ladies, as I said before, were by the anger of one of the ladies
	changed from a happy to a most woeful complexion.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p04030008" />Marseilles, as you know, is situate on the coast of Provence, a
 city ancient and most famous, and in old time the seat of many more
 rich men and great merchants than are to be seen there to-day,
 among whom was one Narnald Cluada by name, a man of the lowest
 origin, but a merchant of unsullied probity and integrity, and boundless
 wealth in lands and goods and money, who had by his lady several
 children, three of them being daughters, older, each of them, than
 the other children, who were sons. <milestone id="p04030009" />Two of the daughters, who
 were twins, were, when my story begins, fifteen years old, and the
 third was but a year younger, so that in order to their marriage their
 kinsfolk awaited nothing but the return of Narnald from Spain,
 whither he was gone with his merchandise. One of the twins was
 called Ninette, the other Madeleine; the third daughter's name was
 Bertelle. <milestone id="p04030010" />A young man, Restagnon by name, who, though poor,
 was of gentle blood, was in the last degree enamoured of Ninette,
 and she of him; and so discreetly had they managed the affair,
 that, never another soul in the world witting aught of it, they had
 had joyance of their love, and that for a good while, when it so
 befell that two young friends of theirs, the one Foulques, the other
 Hugues by name, whom their fathers, recently dead, had left very
 wealthy, fell in love, the one with Madeleine, the other with Bertelle.
 <pb n="286" />
<milestone id="p04030011" />Whereof Restagnon being apprised by Ninette bethought him that
 in their love he might find a means to the relief of his necessities.
 He accordingly consorted freely and familiarly with them, accompanying,
 now one, now the other, and sometimes both of them, when
 they went to visit their ladies and his; <milestone id="p04030012" />and when he judged that he
 had made his footing as friendly and familiar as need was, he bade
 them one day to his house, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Comrades most dear, our
 friendship, perchance, may not have left you without assurance of
 the great love I bear you, and that for you I would do even as much
 as for myself: wherefore, loving you thus much, I purpose to impart
 to you that which is in my mind, that in regard thereof, you and I
 together may then resolve in such sort as to you shall seem the best.
 <milestone id="p04030013" />You, if I may trust your words, as also what I seem to have gathered
 from your demeanour by day and by night, burn with an exceeding
 great love for the two ladies whom you affect, as I for their sister.
 For the assuagement whereof, I have good hope that, if you will
 unite with me, I shall find means most sweet and delightsome; to
 wit, on this wise. <milestone id="p04030014" />You possess, as I do not, great wealth: now if
 you are willing to make of your wealth a common stock with me as
 third partner therein, and to choose some part of the world where
 we may live in careless ease upon our substance, without any manner
 of doubt I trust so to prevail that the three sisters with great part of
 their father's substance shall come to live with us, wherever we shall
 see fit to go; whereby, each with his own lady, we shall live as
 three brethren, the happiest men in the world. 'Tis now for you to
 determine whether you will embrace this proffered solace, or let it
 slip from you.</q> 
<milestone id="p04030015" />The two young men, whose love was beyond all
 measure fervent, spared themselves the trouble of deliberation: 'twas
 enough that they heard that they were to have their ladies: wherefore
 they answered, that, so this should ensue, they were ready to do
 as he proposed. Having thus their answer, Restagnon a few days
 later was closeted with Ninette, to whom 'twas a matter of no small
 difficulty for him to get access. Nor had he been long with her
 before he adverted to what had passed between him and the young
 men, and sought to commend the project to her for reasons not a
 few. 
<milestone id="p04030016" />Little need, however, had he to urge her: for to live their life
 openly together was the very thing she desired, far more than he:
 wherefore she frankly answered that she would have it so, that her
 <pb n="287" />sisters would do, more especially in this matter, just as she wished,
 and that he should lose no time in making all the needful arrangements.
 So Restagnon returned to the two young men, who were
 most urgent that it should be done even as he said, and told them
 that on the part of the ladies the matter was concluded. 
<milestone id="p04030017" />And so,
 having fixed upon Crete for their destination, and sold some estates
 that they had, giving out that they were minded to go a trading with
 the proceeds, they converted all else that they possessed into money,
 and bought a brigantine, which with all secrecy they handsomely
 equipped, anxiously expecting the time of their departure, while
 Ninette on her part, knowing well how her sisters were affected,
 did so by sweet converse foment their desire that, till it should be
 accomplished, they accounted their life as nought. 
<milestone id="p04030018" />The night of
 their embarcation being come, the three sisters opened a great chest
 that belonged to their father, and took out therefrom a vast quantity
 of money and jewels, with which they all three issued forth of the
 house in dead silence, as they had been charged, and found their
 three lovers awaiting them; who, having forthwith brought them
 aboard the brigantine, bade the rowers give way, and, tarrying
 nowhere, arrived the next evening at Genoa, where the new lovers
 had for the first time joyance and solace of their love.</p><p><milestone id="p04030019" />Having taken what they needed of refreshment, they resumed
 their course, touching at this port and that, and in less than eight
 days, speeding without impediment, were come to Crete. There
 they bought them domains both beautiful and broad, whereon, hard
 by Candia they built them mansions most goodly and delightsome,
 wherein they lived as barons, keeping a crowd of retainers, with
 dogs, hawks and horses, and speeding the time with their ladies in
 feasting and revelling and merrymaking, none so light-hearted as
 they. <milestone id="p04030020" />Such being the tenor of their life, it so befell that (as 'tis
 matter of daily experience that, however delightsome a thing may
 be, superabundance thereof will breed disgust) Restagnon, much as
 he had loved Ninette, being now able to have his joyance of her
 without stint or restraint, began to weary of her, and by consequence
 to abate somewhat of his love for her. <milestone id="p04030021" />And being mightily pleased
 with a fair gentlewoman of the country, whom he met at a merry-making,
 he set his whole heart upon her, and began to shew himself
 marvellously courteous and gallant towards her; which Ninette
 per<pb n="288" />ceiving
 grew so jealous that he might not go a step but she knew of
 it, and resented it to his torment and her own with high words. 
<milestone id="p04030022" />But
 as, while superfluity engenders disgust, appetite is but whetted when
 fruit is forbidden, so Ninette's wrath added fuel to the flame of
 Restagnon's new love. And whichever was the event, whether in
 course of time Restagnon had the lady's favour or had it not, Ninette,
 whoever may have brought her the tidings, firmly believed that he
 had it; whereby from the depths of distress she passed into a towering
 passion, and thus was transported into such a frenzy of rage that
 all the love she bore to Restagnon was converted into bitter hatred,
 and, blinded by her wrath, she made up her mind to avenge by
 Restagnon's death the dishonour which she deemed that he had done
 her. <milestone id="p04030023" />So she had recourse to an old Greek woman, that was very
 skilful in compounding poisons, whom by promises and gifts she
 induced to distill a deadly water, which, keeping her own counsel,
 she herself gave Restagnon to drink one evening, when he was
 somewhat heated and quite off his guard: whereby--such was the
 efficacy of the water--she despatched Restagnon before matins. On
 learning his death Foulques and Hugues and their ladies, who knew
 not that he had been poisoned, united their bitter with Ninette's
 feigned lamentations, and gave him honourable sepulture. <milestone id="p04030024" />But so it
 befell that, not many days after, the old woman, that had compounded
 the poison for Ninette, was taken for another crime; and, being put
 to the torture, confessed the compounding of the poison among other
 of her misdeeds, and fully declared what had thereby come to pass.
 Wherefore the Duke of Crete, breathing no word of his intent, came
 privily by night, and set a guard around <milestone id="p04030025" />Foulques' palace, where
 Ninette then was, and quietly, and quite unopposed, took and carried
 her off; and without putting her to the torture, learned from her in
 a trice all that he sought to know touching the death of Restagnon.
 Foulques and Hugues had learned privily of the Duke, and their
 ladies of them, for what cause Ninette was taken; and, being mightily
 distressed thereby, bestirred themselves with all zeal to save Ninette
 from the fire, to which they apprehended she would be condemned,
 as having indeed richly deserved it; but all their endeavours seemed
 to avail nothing, for the Duke was unwaveringly resolved that justice
 should be done. 
<milestone id="p04030026" />Madeleine, Foulques' fair wife, who had long been
 courted by the Duke, but had never deigned to shew him the least
 <pb n="289" />favour, thinking that by yielding herself to his will she might redeem
 her sister from the fire, despatched a trusty envoy to him with the
 intimation that she was entirely at his disposal upon the twofold
 condition, that in the first place her sister should be restored to her
 free and scatheless, and, in the second place, the affair should be kept
 secret. 
<milestone id="p04030027" />Albeit gratified by this overture, the Duke was long in doubt
 whether he should accept it; in the end, however, he made up his
 mind to do so, and signified his approval to the envoy. Then with
 the lady's consent he put Foulques and Hugues under arrest for a
 night, as if he were minded to examine them of the affair, and
 meanwhile quartered himself privily with Madeleine. 
<milestone id="p04030028" />Ninette, who,
 he had made believe, had been set in a sack, and was to be sunk
 in the sea that same night, he took with him, and presented her to
 her sister in requital of the night's joyance, which, as he parted from
 her on the morrow, he prayed her might not be the last, as it was
 the first, fruit of their love, at the same time enjoining her to send
 the guilty lady away that she might not bring reproach upon him,
 nor he be compelled to deal rigorously with her again. 
<milestone id="p04030029" />Released the
 same morning, and told that Ninette had been cast into the sea,
 Foulques and Hugues, fully believing that so it was, came home,
 thinking how they should console their ladies for the death of their
 sister; but, though Madeleine was at great pains to conceal Ninette,
 Foulques nevertheless, to his no small amazement, discovered that
 she was there; which at once excited his suspicion, for he knew that
 the Duke had been enamoured of Madeleine; and he asked how it
 was that Ninette was there. <milestone id="p04030030" />Madeleine made up a long story by
 way of explanation, to which his sagacity gave little credit, and in
 the end after long parley he constrained her to tell the truth. Whereupon,
 overcome with grief, and transported with rage, he drew his
 sword, and, deaf to her appeals for mercy, slew her. 
<milestone id="p04030031" />Then, fearing
 the vengeful justice of the Duke, he left the dead body in the room,
 and hied him to Ninette, and with a counterfeit gladsome mien said
 to her: <q direct="unspecified">Go we without delay whither thy sister has appointed
 that I escort thee, that thou fall not again into the hands of the
 Duke.</q> Ninette believed him, and being fain to go for very fear,
 she forewent further leave-taking of her sister, more particularly as
 it was now night, and set out with Foulques, who took with him
 such little money as he could lay his hands upon; and so they made
 <pb n="290" />their way to the coast, where they got aboard a bark, but none ever
 knew where their voyage ended.</p><p><milestone id="p04030032" />Madeleine's dead body being discovered next day, certain evildisposed
 folk, that bore a grudge to Hugues, forthwith apprised the
 Duke of the fact; which brought the Duke--for much he loved
 Madeleine--in hot haste to the house, where he arrested Hugues and
 his lady, who as yet knew nothing of the departure of Foulques and
 Ninette, and extorted from them a confession that they and Foulques
 were jointly answerable for Madeleine's death. 
<milestone id="p04030033" />For which cause being
 justly apprehensive of death, they with great address corrupted the
 guards that had charge of them, giving them a sum of money which
 they kept concealed in their house against occasions of need; and
 together with the guards fled with all speed, leaving all that they
 possessed behind them, and took ship by night for Rhodes, where,
 being arrived, they lived in great poverty and misery no long time.
 <milestone id="p04030034" />Such then was the issue, to which Restagnon, by his foolish love, and
 Ninette by her wrath brought themselves and others.</p></div2><pb n="291" /><div2 type="novella" who="elissa" id="nov0404"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04040001" />Gerbino, in breach of the plighted faith of his grandfather,

      had two children, a son named Ruggieri, and a daughter named
      Gostanza. Ruggieri died before his father, and left a son named
      Gerbino; who, being carefully trained by his grandfather, grew up a
      most goodly gallant, and of great renown in court and camp, 
      <milestone id="p04040005" />and
      that not only within the borders of Sicily, but in divers other parts

      King of Tunis, who, by averment of all that had seen her, was a

      Nature ever formed. <milestone id="p04040006" />To hear tell of brave men was her delight, and
      what she heard, now from one, now from another, of the brave deeds
      of Gerbino she treasured in her mind so sedulously, and pondered
      them with such pleasure, rehearsing them to herself in imagination,
      that she became hotly enamoured of him, and there was none
      of whom she talked, or heard others talk, so gladly. <milestone id="p04040007" />Nor, on the
      other hand, had the fame of her incomparable beauty and other
      excellences failed to travel, as to other lands, so also to Sicily, where,
      falling on Gerbino's ears, it gave him no small delight, to such effect
      that he burned for the lady no less vehemently than she for him.
      <milestone id="p04040008" />Wherefore, until such time as he might, upon some worthy occasion,
      have his grandfather's leave to go to Tunis, yearning beyond measure
      to see her, he charged every friend of his, that went thither, to give
      her to know, as best he might, his great and secret love for her, and
      to bring him tidings of her. Which office one of the said friends
      discharged with no small address; for, having obtained access to her,
      after the manner of merchants, by bringing jewels for her to look at,
      he fully apprised her of Gerbino's passion, and placed him, and all
      that he possessed, entirely at her disposal. <milestone id="p04040009" />The lady received both
      messenger and message with gladsome mien, made answer that she
      loved with equal ardour, and in token thereof sent Gerbino one of
      her most precious jewels. Gerbino received the jewel with extreme
      delight, and sent her many a letter and many a most precious gift by
      the hand of the same messenger; and 'twas well understood between
      them that, should Fortune accord him opportunity, he should see
      and know her.</p><p><milestone id="p04040010" />On this footing the affair remained somewhat longer than was
 expedient; and so, while Gerbino and the lady burned with mutual
 love, it befell that the King of Tunis gave her in marriage to the
 King of Granada;<note>An anachronism; the Moorish kingdom of Granada not
 having been
 founded until 1238.</note> whereat she was wroth beyond measure, for that
 <pb n="293" />she was not only going into a country remote from her lover, but, as
 she deemed, was severed from him altogether; and so this might not
 come to pass, gladly, could she but have seen how, would she have
 left her father and fled to Gerbino. <milestone id="p04040011" />In like manner, Gerbino, on
 learning of the marriage, was vexed beyond measure, and was ofttimes
 minded, could he but find means to win to her husband by
 sea, to wrest her from him by force. <milestone id="p04040012" />Some rumour of Gerbino's love,
 and of his intent, reached the King of Tunis, who, knowing his
 prowess and power, took alarm, and as the time drew nigh for
 conveying the lady to Granada, sent word of his purpose to King
 Guglielmo, and craved his assurance that it might be carried into
 effect without let or hindrance on the part of Gerbino, or any one
 else. <milestone id="p04040013" />The old King had heard nothing of Gerbino's love affair, and
 never dreaming that 'twas on such account that the assurance was
 craved, granted it without demur, and in pledge thereof sent the
 King of Tunis his glove. Which received, the King made ready
 a great and goodly ship in the port of Carthage, and equipped
 her with all things meet for those that were to man her, and
 with all appointments apt and seemly for the reception of his
 daughter, and awaited only fair weather to send her therein to
 Granada. <milestone id="p04040014" />All which the young lady seeing and marking, sent
 one of her servants privily to Palermo, bidding him greet the
 illustrious Gerbino on her part, and tell him that a few days
 would see her on her way to Granada; wherefore 'twould now appear
 whether, or no, he were really as doughty a man as he was reputed,
 and loved her as much as he had so often protested. 
<milestone id="p04040015" />The servant
 did not fail to deliver her message exactly, and returned to Tunis,
 leaving Gerbino, who knew that his grandfather, King Guglielmo,
 had given the King of Tunis the desired assurance, at a loss how to
 act. But prompted by love, and goaded by the lady's words and
 loath to seem a craven, he hied him to Messina; and having there
 armed two light galleys, and manned them with good men and true,
 he put to sea, and stood for Sardinia, deeming that the lady's ship must
 pass that way. <milestone id="p04040016" />Nor was he far out in his reckoning; for he had
 not been there many days, when the ship, sped by a light breeze, hove
 in sight not far from the place where he lay in wait for her. Whereupon
 Gerbino said to his comrades: <q direct="unspecified">Gentlemen, if you be as good
 men and true as I deem you, there is none of you but must have felt, if
 <pb n="294" />he feel not now, the might of love; for without love I deem no
 mortal capable of true worth or aught that is good; and if you are
 or have been in love, 'twill be easy for you to understand that which
 I desire. <milestone id="p04040017" />I love, and 'tis because I love that I have laid this travail
 upon you; and that which I love is in the ship that you see before
 you, which is fraught not only with my beloved, but with immense
 treasures, which, if you are good men and true, we, so we but play
 the man in fight, may with little trouble make our own; nor for
 my share of the spoils of the victory demand I aught but a lady,
 whose love it is that prompts me to take arms: all else I freely cede
 to you from this very hour. Forward, then; attack we this ship;
 success should be ours, for God favours our enterprise, nor lends her
 wind to evade us.</q> 
<milestone id="p04040018" />Fewer words might have sufficed the illustrious
 Gerbino; for the rapacious Messinese that were with him were
 already bent heart and soul upon that to which by his harangue he
 sought to animate them. So, when he had done, they raised a
 mighty shout, so that 'twas as if trumpets did blare, and caught up
 their arms, and smiting the water with their oars, overhauled the
 ship. <milestone id="p04040019" />The advancing galleys were observed while they were yet a
 great way off by the ship's crew, who, not being able to avoid the
 combat, put themselves in a posture of defence. Arrived at close
 quarters, the illustrious Gerbino bade send the ship's masters aboard
 the galleys, unless they were minded to do battle. 
<milestone id="p04040020" />Certified of the
 challenge, and who they were that made it, the Saracens answered
 that 'twas in breach of the faith plighted to them by their assailants'
 king that they were thus attacked, and in token thereof displayed
 King Guglielmo's glove, averring in set terms that there should be
 no surrender either of themselves or of aught that was aboard the
 ship without battle. 
<milestone id="p04040021" />Gerbino, who had observed the lady standing
 on the ship's poop, and seen that she was far more beautiful than he
 had imagined, burned with a yet fiercer flame than before, and to
 the display of the glove made answer, that, as he had no falcons there
 just then, the glove booted him not; wherefore, so they were not
 minded to surrender the lady, let them prepare to receive battle.
 <milestone id="p04040022" />Whereupon, without further delay, the battle began on both sides
 with a furious discharge of arrows and stones; on which wise it was
 long protracted to their common loss; <milestone id="p04040023" />until at last Gerbino, seeing
 that he gained little advantage, took a light bark which they had
 <pb n="295" />brought from Sardinia, and having fired her, bore down with her,
 and both the galleys, upon the ship. Whereupon the Saracens,
 seeing that they must perforce surrender the ship or die, caused the
 King's daughter, who lay beneath the deck weeping, to come up on
 deck, and led her to the prow, and shouting to Gerbino, while the
 lady shrieked alternately <q direct="unspecified">mercy</q> and <q direct="unspecified">succour,</q> opened her veins
 before his eyes, and cast her into the sea, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Take her; we
 give her to thee on such wise as we can, and as thy faith has merited.</q>
 <milestone id="p04040024" />Maddened to witness this deed of barbarism, Gerbino, as if courting
 death, recked no more of the arrows and the stones, but drew alongside
 the ship, and, despite the resistance of her crew, boarded her;
 and as a famished lion ravens amongst a herd of oxen, and tearing
 and rending, now one, now another, gluts his wrath before he appeases
 his hunger, so Gerbino, sword in hand, hacking and hewing on all
 sides among the Saracens, did ruthlessly slaughter not a few of them;
 till, as the burning ship began to blaze more fiercely, he bade the
 seamen take thereout all that they might by way of guerdon, which
 done, he quitted her, having gained but a rueful victory over his
 adversaries. <milestone id="p04040025" />His next care was to recover from the sea the body of
 the fair lady, whom long and with many a tear he mourned: and
 so he returned to Sicily, and gave the body honourable sepulture in
 Ustica, an islet that faces, as it were, Trapani, and went home the
 saddest man alive.</p><p><milestone id="p04040026" />When these tidings reached the King of Tunis, he sent to King
 Guglielmo ambassadors, habited in black, who made complaint
 of the breach of faith and recited the manner of its occurrence.
 Which caused King Guglielmo no small chagrin; and seeing not
 how he might refuse the justice they demanded, he had Gerbino
 arrested, and he himself, none of his barons being able by any
 entreaty to turn him from his purpose, sentenced him to forfeit his
 head, and had it severed from his body in his presence, preferring
 to suffer the loss of his only grandson than to gain the reputation of
 a faithless king. <milestone id="p04040027" />And so, miserably, within the compass of a few
 brief days, died the two lovers by woeful deaths, as I have told you,
 and without having known any joyance of their love.</p></div2><pb n="296" /><div2 type="novella" who="filomena" id="nov0405"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04050001" />Lisabetta's brothers slay her lover: he appears to her in

 were brothers and merchants, who were left very rich on the death
 of their father, who was of San Gimignano; and they had a sister,
 Lisabetta by name, a girl fair enough, and no less debonair, but
 whom, for some reason or another, they had not as yet bestowed in
 marriage. <milestone id="p04050005" />The three brothers had also in their shop a young Pisan,
 Lorenzo by name, who managed all their affairs, and who was so
 goodly of person and gallant, that Lisabetta bestowed many a glance
 upon him, and began to regard him with extraordinary favour;
 which Lorenzo marking from time to time, gave up all his other
 amours, and in like manner began to affect her, and so, their loves
 being equal, 'twas not long before they took heart of grace, and did
 that which each most desired. <milestone id="p04050006" />Wherein continuing to their no
 small mutual solace and delight, they neglected to order it with due
 <pb n="297" />secrecy, whereby one night as Lisabetta was going to Lorenzo's
 room, she, all unwitting, was observed by the eldest of the brothers,
 who, albeit much distressed by what he had learnt, yet, being a
 young man of discretion, was swayed by considerations more seemly,
 and, allowing no word to escape him, spent the night in turning the
 affair over in his mind in divers ways. <milestone id="p04050007" />On the morrow he told his
 brothers that which, touching Lisabetta and Lorenzo, he had observed
 in the night, which, that no shame might thence ensue either to
 them or to their sister, they after long consultation determined to pass
 over in silence, making as if they had seen or heard nought thereof,
 until such time as they in a safe and convenient manner might
 banish this disgrace from their sight before it could go further.
 <milestone id="p04050008" />Adhering to which purpose, they jested and laughed with Lorenzo
 as they had been wont; and after a while pretending that they were
 all three going forth of the city on pleasure, they took Lorenzo with
 them; and being come to a remote and very lonely spot, seeing that
 'twas apt for their design, they took Lorenzo, who was completely
 off his guard, and slew him, and buried him on such wise that none
 was ware of it. <milestone id="p04050009" />On their return to Messina they gave out that they
 had sent him away on business; which was readily believed, because
 'twas what they had been frequently used to do. <milestone id="p04050010" />But as Lorenzo
 did not return, and Lisabetta questioned the brothers about him with
 great frequency and urgency, being sorely grieved by his long
 absence, it so befell that one day, when she was very pressing in her
 enquiries, one of the brothers said: <q direct="unspecified">What means this? What
 hast thou to do with Lorenzo, that thou shouldst ask about him so
 often? Ask us no more, or we will give thee such answer as thou
 deservest.</q> 
<milestone id="p04050011" />So the girl, sick at heart and sorrowful, fearing she
 knew not what, asked no questions; but many a time at night she
 called piteously to him, and besought him to come to her, and
 bewailed his long tarrying with many a tear, and ever yearning for
 his return, languished in total dejection.</p><p><milestone id="p04050012" />But so it was that one night, when, after long weeping that her
 Lorenzo came not back, she had at last fallen asleep, Lorenzo
 appeared to her in a dream, wan and in utter disarray, his clothes
 torn to shreds and sodden; and thus, as she thought, he spoke:
 <milestone id="p04050013" /><q direct="unspecified">Lisabetta, thou dost nought but call me, and vex thyself for my
 long tarrying, and bitterly upbraid me with thy tears; wherefore be
 <pb n="298" />it known to thee that return to thee I may not, because the last day
 that thou didst see me thy brothers slew me.</q> After which, he
 described the place where they had buried him, told her to call and
 expect him no more, and vanished. <milestone id="p04050014" />The girl then awoke, and
 doubting not that the vision was true, wept bitterly. And when
 morning came, and she was risen, not daring to say aught to her
 brothers, she resolved to go to the place indicated in the vision, and
 see if what she had dreamed were even as it had appeared to her.
 <milestone id="p04050015" />So, having leave to go a little way out of the city for recreation in
 company with a maid that had at one time lived with them and
 knew all that she did, she hied her thither with all speed; and having
 removed the dry leaves that were strewn about the place, she began
 to dig where the earth seemed least hard. Nor had she dug long,
 before she found the body of her hapless lover, whereon as yet
 there was no trace of corruption or decay; and thus she saw without
 any manner of doubt that her vision was true. <milestone id="p04050016" />And so, saddest of
 women, knowing that she might not bewail him there, she would
 gladly, if she could, have carried away the body and given it more
 honourable sepulture elsewhere; but as she might not so do, she
 took a knife, and, as best she could, severed the head from the trunk,
 and wrapped it in a napkin and laid it in the lap of her maid; and
 having covered the rest of the corpse with earth, she left the spot,
 having been seen by none, and went home. <milestone id="p04050017" />There she shut herself
 up in her room with the head, and kissed it a thousand times in every
 part, and wept long and bitterly over it, till she had bathed it in her
 tears. She then wrapped it in a piece of fine cloth, and set it in a
 large and beautiful pot of the sort in which marjoram or basil is
 planted, and covered it with earth, and therein planted some roots
 of the goodliest basil of Salerno, and drenched them only with her
 tears, or water perfumed with roses or orange-blossoms. <milestone id="p04050018" />And 'twas
 her wont ever to sit beside this pot, and, all her soul one yearning, to
 pore upon it, as that which enshrined her Lorenzo, <milestone id="p04050019" />and when long
 time she had so done, she would bend over it, and weep a great
 while, until the basil was quite bathed in her tears.</p><p><milestone id="p04050020" />Fostered with such constant, unremitting care, and nourished by
 the richness given to the soil by the decaying head that lay therein,
 the basil burgeoned out in exceeding great beauty and fragrance.
 And, the girl persevering ever in this way of life, the neighbours from
 <pb n="299" />time to time took note of it, and when her brothers marvelled to see
 her beauty ruined, and her eyes as it were evanished from her head,
 they told them of it, saying: <q direct="unspecified">We have observed that such is her
 daily wont.</q> Whereupon the brothers, marking her behaviour, chid
 her therefore once or twice, and as she heeded them not, caused the
 pot to be taken privily from her. Which, so soon as she missed it,
 she demanded with the utmost instance and insistence, and, as they
 gave it not back to her, ceased not to wail and weep, insomuch that
 she fell sick; nor in her sickness craved she aught but the pot of
 basil. <milestone id="p04050021" />Whereat the young men, marvelling mightily, resolved to
 see what the pot might contain; and having removed the earth they
 espied the cloth, and therein the head, which was not yet so decayed,
 but that by the curled locks they knew it for Lorenzo's head. <milestone id="p04050022" />Passing
 strange they found it, and fearing lest it should be bruited abroad,
 they buried the head, and, with as little said as might be, took order
 for their privy departure from Messina, and hied them thence to
 Naples. <milestone id="p04050023" />The girl ceased not to weep and crave her pot, and, so
 weeping, died. Such was the end of her disastrous love; but not a
 few in course of time coming to know the truth of the affair, there
 was one that made the song that is still sung: to wit:</p><div3 type="song"><lg><milestone id="p04050024" />

	the sleeper, while he sleeps, deems all alike most true, but, being

	And on the other hand there are those that credit no dream, until

 Messer Negro da Ponte Carraro, who with other children had a
 very fair daughter, Andreuola by name, who, being unmarried,
 chanced to fall in love with a neighbour, one Gabriotto, a man of
 low degree, but goodly of person and debonair, and endowed with
 all admirable qualities; <milestone id="p04060009" />and aided and abetted by the housemaid, the
 girl not only brought it to pass that Gabriotto knew that he was
 beloved of her, but that many a time to their mutual delight he
 came to see her in a fair garden belonging to her father. And that
 nought but death might avail to sever them from this their gladsome
 love, they became privily man and wife; and, while thus they
 continued their clandestine intercourse, it happened that one night,
 while the girl slept, she saw herself in a dream in her garden with
 Gabriotto, who to the exceeding great delight of both held her in his
 arms; <milestone id="p04060010" />and while thus they lay, she saw issue from his body somewhat
 dark and frightful, the shape whereof she might not discern;
 which, as she thought, laid hold of Gabriotto, and in her despite
 with prodigious force reft him from her embrace, and bore him with
 it underground, so that both were lost to her sight for evermore:
 <milestone id="p04060011" />whereby stricken with sore and inexpressible grief, she awoke; and
 albeit she was overjoyed to find that 'twas not as she had dreamed,
 yet a haunting dread of what she had seen in her vision entered her
 <pb n="304" />soul. Wherefore, Gabriotto being minded to visit her on the ensuing
 night, she did her best endeavour to dissuade him from coming; but
 seeing that he was bent upon it, lest he should suspect somewhat,
 she received him in her garden, <milestone id="p04060012" />where, having culled roses many,
 white and red--for 'twas summer--she sat herself down with him
 at the base of a most fair and lucent fountain. There long and
 joyously they dallied, and then Gabriotto asked her wherefore she
 had that day forbade his coming. Whereupon the lady told him
 her dream of the night before, and the doubt and fear which it had
 engendered in her mind. <milestone id="p04060013" />Whereat Gabriotto laughed, and said that
 'twas the height of folly to put any faith in dreams, for that they
 were occasioned by too much or too little food, and were daily seen
 to be, one and all, things of nought, adding: 
<milestone id="p04060014" /><q direct="unspecified">Were I minded to
 give heed to dreams, I should not be here now, for I, too, had a
 dream last night, which was on this wise: Methought I was in
 a fair and pleasant wood, and there, a hunting, caught a she-goat as
 beautiful and loveable as any that ever was seen, and, as it seemed to
 me, whiter than snow, which in a little while grew so tame and
 friendly that she never stirred from my side. 
<milestone id="p04060015" />All the same so jealous
 was I lest she should leave me, that, meseemed, I had set a collar of
 gold around her neck, and held her by a golden chain. 
<milestone id="p04060016" />And presently
 meseemed that, while the she-goat lay at rest with her head in my
 lap, there came forth, I knew not whence, a greyhound bitch, black
 as coal, famished, and most fearsome to look upon; which made
 straight for me, and for, meseemed, I offered no resistance, set her
 muzzle to my breast on the left side and gnawed through to the
 heart, which, meseemed, she tore out to carry away with her.
 <milestone id="p04060017" />Whereupon ensued so sore a pain that it brake my sleep, and as I
 awoke I laid my hand to my side to feel if aught were amiss there;
 but finding nothing I laughed at myself that I had searched. But
 what signifies it all? Visions of the like sort, ay, and far more
 appalling, have I had in plenty, and nought whatever, great or small,
 has come of any of them. So let it pass, and think we how we may
 speed the time merrily.</q></p><p><milestone id="p04060018" />What she heard immensely enhanced the already great dread
 which her own dream had inspired in the girl; but, not to vex
 Gabriotto, she dissembled her terror as best she might. But, though
 she made great cheer, embracing and kissing him, and receiving his
 <pb n="305" />embraces and kisses, yet she felt a doubt, she knew not why, and
 many a time, more than her wont, she would gaze upon his face,
 and ever and anon her glance would stray through the garden to
 see if any black creature were coming from any quarter. 
<milestone id="p04060019" />While
 thus they passed the time, of a sudden Gabriotto heaved a great
 sigh, and embracing her, said: <q direct="unspecified">Alas! my soul, thy succour! for
 I die.</q> And so saying, he fell down upon the grassy mead. 
<milestone id="p04060020" />Whereupon
 the girl drew him to her, and laid him on her lap, and all
 but wept, and said: <q direct="unspecified">O sweet my lord, what is't that ails thee?</q>
 <milestone id="p04060021" />But Gabriotto was silent, and gasping sore for breath, and bathed
 in sweat, in no long time departed this life.</p><p><milestone id="p04060022" />How grievous was the distress of the girl, who loved him more
 than herself, you, my ladies, may well imagine. With many a tear
 she mourned him, and many times she vainly called him by his
 name; but when, having felt his body all over, and found it cold in
 every part, she could no longer doubt that he was dead, knowing not
 what to say or do, she went, tearful and woebegone, to call the
 maid, to whom she had confided her love, and shewed her the
 woeful calamity that had befallen her. <milestone id="p04060023" />Piteously a while they wept
 together over the dead face of Gabriotto, and then the girl said to
 the maid: <q direct="unspecified">Now that God has reft him from me, I have no
 mind to linger in this life; but before I slay myself, I would we
 might find apt means to preserve my honour, and the secret of our
 love, and to bury the body from which the sweet soul has fled.</q>
 <milestone id="p04060024" /><q direct="unspecified">My daughter,</q> said the maid, <q direct="unspecified">speak not of slaying thyself, for
 so wouldst thou lose in the other world, also, him that thou hast
 lost here; seeing that thou wouldst go to hell, whither, sure I am,
 his soul is not gone, for a good youth he was; far better were it to
 put on a cheerful courage, and bethink thee to succour his soul with
 thy prayers or pious works, if perchance he have need thereof by
 reason of any sin that he may have committed. 
<milestone id="p04060025" />We can bury him
 readily enough in this garden, nor will any one ever know; for
 none knows that he ever came hither; and if thou wilt not have
 it so, we can bear him forth of the garden, and leave him there;
 and on the morrow he will be found, and carried home, and buried
 by his kinsfolk.</q> 
<milestone id="p04060026" />The girl, heavy-laden though she was with
 anguish, and still weeping, yet gave ear to the counsels of her maid,
 and rejecting the former alternative, made answer to the latter on
 <pb n="306" />this wise: <q direct="unspecified">Now God forbid that a youth so dear, whom I have
 so loved and made my husband, should with my consent be buried
 like a dog, or left out there in the street. He has had my tears, and
 so far as I may avail, he shall have the tears of his kinsfolk, and
 already wot I what we must do.</q> 
<milestone id="p04060027" />And forthwith she sent the maid
 for a piece of silken cloth, which she had in one of her boxes; and
 when the maid returned with it, they spread it on the ground, and
 laid Gabriotto's body thereon, resting the head upon a pillow. She
 then closed the eyes and mouth, shedding the while many a tear,
 wove for him a wreath of roses, and strewed upon him all the roses
 that he and she had gathered; which done, she said to the maid:
 <milestone id="p04060028" /><q direct="unspecified">'Tis but a short way hence to the door of his house; so thither we
 will bear him, thou and I, thus as we have dight him, and will lay
 him at the door. Day will soon dawn, and they will take him up;
 and, though 'twill be no consolation to them, I, in whose arms he
 died, shall be glad of it.</q> 
<milestone id="p04060029" />So saying, she burst once more into a
 torrent of tears, and fell with her face upon the face of the dead, and
 so long time she wept. Then, yielding at last to the urgency of her
 maid, for day was drawing nigh, she arose, drew from her finger the
 ring with which she had been wedded to Gabriotto, and set it on
 his finger, saying with tears: 
<milestone id="p04060030" /><q direct="unspecified">Dear my lord, if thy soul be witness
 of my tears, or if, when the spirit is fled, aught of intelligence or
 sense still lurk in the body, graciously receive the last gift of her
 whom in life thou didst so dearly love.</q> Which said, she swooned,
 and fell upon the corpse; 
<milestone id="p04060031" />but, coming after a while to herself, she
 arose; and then she and her maid took the cloth whereon the body
 lay, and so bearing it, quitted the garden, and bent their steps towards
 the dead man's house. As thus they went, it chanced that certain
 of the Podest&#224;'s guard, that for some reason or another were abroad
 at that hour, met them, and arrested them with the corpse. 
<milestone id="p04060032" />Andreuola,
 to whom death was more welcome than life, no sooner knew
 them for the officers of the Signory than she frankly said: <q direct="unspecified">I know
 you, who you are, and that flight would avail me nothing: I am
 ready to come with you before the Signory, and to tell all there is to
 tell; but let none of you presume to touch me, so long as I obey
 you, or to take away aught that is on this body, if he would not that
 I accuse him.</q> And so, none venturing to lay hand upon either her
 person or the corpse, she entered the palace.</p><pb n="307" /><p><milestone id="p04060033" />So soon as the Podest&#224; was apprised of the affair, he arose,
 had
 her brought into his room, and there made himself conversant with
 the circumstances: and certain physicians being charged to inquire
 whether the good man had met his death by poison or otherwise, all
 with one accord averred that 'twas not by poison, but that he was
 choked by the bursting of an imposthume near the heart. 
<milestone id="p04060034" />Which
 when the Podest&#224; heard, perceiving that the girl's guilt could but
 be slight, he sought to make a pretence of giving what it was not
 lawful for him to sell her, and told her that he would set her at
 liberty, so she were consenting to pleasure him; 
<milestone id="p04060035" />but finding that he
 did but waste his words he cast aside all decency, and would have
 used force. Whereupon Andreuola, kindling with scorn, waxed
 exceeding brave, and defended herself with a virile energy, and with
 high and contumelious words drove him from her.</p><p><milestone id="p04060036" />When 'twas broad day, the affair reached the ears of Messer
 Negro, who, half dead with grief, hied him with not a few of his
 friends to the palace; where, having heard all that the Podest&#224; had
 to say, he required him peremptorily to give him back his daughter.
 <milestone id="p04060037" />The Podest&#224;, being minded rather to be his own accuser, than that
 he should be accused by the girl of the violence that he had meditated
 towards her, began by praising her and her constancy, and in proof
 thereof went on to tell what he had done; he ended by saying, that,
 marking her admirable firmness, he had fallen mightily in love with
 her, and so, notwithstanding she had been wedded to a man of low
 degree, he would, if 'twere agreeable to her and to her father, Messer
 Negro, gladly make her his wife. <milestone id="p04060038" />While they thus spoke, Andreuola
 made her appearance, and, weeping, threw herself at her father's feet,
 saying: <q direct="unspecified">My father, I wot I need not tell you the story of my
 presumption, and the calamity that has befallen me, for sure I am
 that you have heard it and know it; wherefore, with all possible
 humility I crave your pardon of my fault, to wit, that without your
 knowledge I took for my husband him that pleased me best. 
<milestone id="p04060039" />And
 this I crave, not that my life may be spared, but that I may die as
 your daughter and not as your enemy;</q> and so, weeping, she fell at
 his feet. 
<milestone id="p04060040" />Messer Negro, now an old man, and naturally kindly and
 affectionate, heard her not without tears, and weeping raised her
 tenderly to her feet, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Daughter mine, I had much liefer
 had it that thou hadst had a husband that I deemed a match for thee;
 <pb n="308" />and in that thou hadst taken one that pleased thee I too had been
 pleased; but thy concealing thy choice from me is grievous to me
 by reason of thy distrust of me, and yet more so, seeing that thou
 hast lost him before I have known him. 
<milestone id="p04060041" />But as 'tis even so, to his
 remains be paid the honour which, while he lived for thy contentment,
 I had gladly done him as my son-in-law.</q> Then, turning to
 his sons and kinsmen, he bade them order Gabriotto's obsequies with
 all pomp and honourable circumstance.</p><p><milestone id="p04060042" />Meanwhile the young man's kinsmen and kinswomen, having
 heard the news, had flocked thither, bringing with them almost all the
 rest of the folk, men and women alike, that were in the city. And so
 his body, resting on Andreuola's cloth, and covered with her roses,
 was laid out in the middle of the courtyard, and there was mourned
 not by her and his kinsfolk alone, but publicly by well-nigh all the
 women of the city, and not a few men; and shouldered by some of
 the noblest of the citizens, as it had been the remains of no plebeian
 but of a noble, was borne from the public courtyard to the tomb
 with exceeding great pomp.</p><p><milestone id="p04060043" />Some days afterwards, as the Podest&#224; continued to urge his suit,
 Messer Negro would have discussed the matter with his daughter;
 but, as she would hear none of it, and he was minded in this matter
 to defer to her wishes, she and her maid entered a religious house of
 great repute for sanctity, where in just esteem they lived long time
 thereafter.</p></div2><pb n="309" /><div2 type="novella" who="emilia" id="nov0407"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04070001" />Simona loves Pasquino; they are together in a garden;

 Emilia made no demur, and thus began:</p></div3><div3 who="emilia" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p04070003" />Dear gossips, Pamfilo's story puts me upon telling you another in
	no wise like thereto, save in this, that as Andreuola lost her lover in
	a garden, so also did she of whom I am to speak, and, being arrested
	like Andreuola, did also deliver herself from the court, albeit 'twas
	not by any vigour or firmness of mind, but by a sudden death. 
	<milestone id="p04070004" />And,
	as 'twas said among us a while ago, albeit Love affects the mansions
	of the noble, he does not, therefore, disdain the dominion of the
	dwellings of the poor, nay, does there at times give proof of his might
	no less signal than when he makes him feared of the wealthiest as a
	most potent lord. <milestone id="p04070005" />Which, though not fully, will in some degree
	appear in my story, wherewith I am minded to return to our city,
	from which to-day's discourse, roving from matter to matter, and
	one part of the world to another, has carried us so far.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p04070006" />Know then that no great while ago there dwelt in Florence a
 maid most fair, and, for her rank, debonair--she was but a poor
 man's daughter--whose name was Simona; and though she must
 needs win with her own hands the bread she ate, and maintain
 herself by spinning wool; yet was she not, therefore, of so poor a
 <pb n="310" />spirit, but that she dared to give harbourage in her mind to Love,
 who for some time had sought to gain entrance there by means of
 the gracious deeds and words of a young man of her own order that
 went about distributing wool to spin for his master, a wool-monger.
 <milestone id="p04070007" />Love being thus, with the pleasant image of her beloved Pasquino,
 admitted into her soul, mightily did she yearn, albeit she hazarded no
 advance, and heaved a thousand sighs fiercer than fire with every
 skein of yarn that she wound upon her spindle, while she called to
 mind who he was that had given her that wool to spin. 
<milestone id="p04070008" />Pasquino
 on his part became, meanwhile, very anxious that his master's wool
 should be well spun, and most particularly about that which Simona
 span, as if, indeed, it and it alone was to furnish forth the whole of
 the cloth. <milestone id="p04070009" />And so, what with the anxiety which the one evinced,
 and the gratification that it afforded to the other, it befell that, the
 one waxing unusually bold, and the other casting off not a little
 of her wonted shyness and reserve, they came to an understanding
 for their mutual solace; which proved so delightful to both, that
 neither waited to be bidden by the other, but 'twas rather which
 should be the first to make the overture.</p><p><milestone id="p04070010" />While thus they sped their days in an even tenor of delight, and
 ever grew more ardently enamoured of one another, Pasquino
 chanced to say to Simona that he wished of all things she would
 contrive how she might betake her to a garden, whither he would
 bring her, that there they might be more at their ease, and in greater
 security. <milestone id="p04070011" />Simona said that she was agreeable; and, having given her
 father to understand that she was minded to go to San Gallo for the
 pardoning, she hied her with one of her gossips, Lagina by name, to
 the garden of which Pasquino had told her. Here she found
 Pasquino awaiting her with a friend, one Puccino, otherwise Stramba;
 and Stramba and Lagina falling at once to love-making, Pasquino
 and Simona left a part of the garden to them, and withdrew to
 another part for their own solace.</p><p><milestone id="p04070012" />Now there was in their part of the garden a very fine and lovely
 sage-bush, at foot of which they sat them down and made merry
 together a great while, and talked much of a junketing they meant
 to have in the garden quite at their ease. By and by Pasquino,
 turning to the great sage-bush, plucked therefrom a leaf, and fell to
 rubbing his teeth and gums therewith, saying that sage was an
 <pb n="311" />excellent detergent of aught that remained upon them after a meal.
 <milestone id="p04070013" />Having done so, he returned to the topic of the junketing of which
 he had spoken before. But he had not pursued it far before his
 countenance entirely changed, and forthwith he lost sight and speech,
 and shortly after died. <milestone id="p04070014" />Whereupon Simona fell a weeping and
 shrieking and calling Stramba and Lagina; who, notwithstanding
 they came up with all speed, found Pasquino not only dead but
 already swollen from head to foot, and covered with black spots both
 on the face and on the body; whereupon Stramba broke forth
 with: <q direct="unspecified">Ah! wicked woman! thou hast poisoned him;</q> 
<milestone id="p04070015" />and made
 such a din that 'twas heard by not a few that dwelt hard by the
 garden; who also hasted to the spot, and seeing Pasquino dead and
 swollen, and hearing Stramba bewail himself and accuse Simona of
 having maliciously poisoned him, while she, all but beside herself for
 grief to be thus suddenly bereft of her lover, knew not how to defend
 herself, did all with one accord surmise that 'twas even as Stramba
 said. <milestone id="p04070016" />Wherefore they laid hands on her, and brought her, still
 weeping bitterly, to the palace of the Podest&#224;: where at the instant
 suit of Stramba, backed by Atticciato and Malagevole, two other
 newly-arrived friends of Pasquino, a judge forthwith addressed himself
 to question her of the matter; and being unable to discover
 that she had used any wicked practice, or was guilty, he resolved to
 take her with him and go see the corpse, and the place, and the
 manner of the death, as she had recounted it to him; for by her
 words he could not well understand it. <milestone id="p04070017" />So, taking care that there
 should be no disturbance, he had her brought to the place where
 Pasquino's corpse lay swollen like a tun, whither he himself presently
 came, and marvelling as he examined the corpse, asked her
 how the death had come about. <milestone id="p04070018" />Whereupon, standing by the sagebush,
 she told him all that had happened, and that he might perfectly
 apprehend the occasion of the death, she did as Pasquino had
 done, plucked one of the leaves from the bush, and rubbed her teeth
 with it. Whereupon Stramba and Atticciato, and the rest of the
 friends and comrades of Pasquino, making in the presence of the
 judge open mock of what she did, as an idle and vain thing, and
 being more than ever instant to affirm her guilt, and to demand the
 fire as the sole condign penalty, the poor creature, that, between
 grief for her lost lover and dread of the doom demanded by Stramba,
 <pb n="312" />stood mute and helpless, was stricken no less suddenly, and in the
 same manner, and for the same cause (to wit, that she had rubbed
 her teeth with the sage leaf) as Pasquino, to the no small amazement
 of all that were present.</p><p><milestone id="p04070019" />Oh! happy souls for whom one and the same day was the
 term of ardent love and earthly life! Happier still, if to the
 same bourn ye fared! Ay, and even yet more happy, if love
 there be in the other world, and there, even as here, ye love!
 <milestone id="p04070020" />But happiest above all Simona, so far as we, whom she has left
 behind, may judge, in that Fortune brooked not that the witness of
 Stramba, Atticciato and Malagevole, carders, perchance, or yet viler
 fellows, should bear down her innocence, but found a more seemly
 issue, and, appointing her a like lot with her lover, gave her at once
 to clear herself from their foul accusation, and to follow whither the
 soul, that she so loved, of her Pasquino had preceded her!</p><p><milestone id="p04070021" />The judge, and all else that witnessed the event, remained long
 time in a sort of stupefaction, knowing not what to say of it; but at
 length recovering his wits, the judge said: <q direct="unspecified">'Twould seem that
 this sage is poisonous, which the sage is not used to be. Let it be
 cut down to the roots and burned, lest another suffer by it in like
 sort.</q>
 <milestone id="p04070022" />Which the gardener proceeding to do in the judge's presence, no sooner
 had he brought the great bush down, than the cause of the deaths of
 the two lovers plainly appeared: <milestone id="p04070023" />for underneath it was a toad of prodigious
 dimensions, from whose venomous breath, as they conjectured,
 the whole of the bush had contracted a poisonous quality. Around
 which toad, none venturing to approach it, they set a stout ring-fence
 of faggots, and burned it together with the sage. So ended Master
 Judge's inquest on the death of hapless Pasquino, 
<milestone id="p04070024" />who with his
 Simona, swollen as they were, were buried by Stramba, Atticciato,
 Guccio Imbratta, and Malagevole in the church of San Paolo, of
 which, as it so happened, they were parishioners.</p></div2><pb n="313" /><div2 type="novella" who="neifile" id="nov0408"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04080001" />Girolamo loves Salvestra: yielding to his mother's prayers

	thinking to unseat Love from the heart that he had occupied, and

	her son.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p04080005" />Know, then, that, as 'tis related by them of old time, there was
 once in our city a very great and wealthy merchant, Leonardo
 Sighieri by name, who had by his lady a son named Girolamo, after
 whose birth he departed this life, leaving his affairs in meet and due
 order; and well and faithfully were they afterwards administered in
 <pb n="314" />the interest of the boy by his mother and guardians. 
<milestone id="p04080006" />As he grew
 up, consorting more frequently with the neighbours' children than
 any others of the quarter, he made friends with a girl of his own
 age that was the daughter of a tailor; and in course of time this
 friendship ripened into a love so great and vehement, that Girolamo
 was ever ill at ease when he saw her not; nor was her love for him
 a whit less strong than his for her. <milestone id="p04080007" />Which his mother perceiving
 would not seldom chide him therefor and chastise him. And as
 Girolamo could not give it up, she confided her distress to his
 guardians, speaking--for by reason of her boy's great wealth she
 thought to make, as it were, an orange-tree out of a bramble--on
 this wise: 
<milestone id="p04080008" /><q direct="unspecified">This boy of ours, who is now scarce fourteen years
 old, is so in love with a daughter of one of our neighbours, a
 tailor--Salvestra
 is the girl's name--that, if we part them not, he will, peradventure,
 none else witting, take her to wife some day, and I shall
 never be happy again; or, if he see her married to another, he will
 pine away; <milestone id="p04080009" />to prevent which, methinks, you would do well to send
 him away to distant parts on the affairs of the shop; for so, being
 out of sight she will come at length to be out of mind, and then we
 can give him some well-born girl to wife.</q> 
<milestone id="p04080010" />Whereto the guardians
 answered, that 'twas well said, and that it should be so done to the
 best of their power: so they called the boy into the shop, and one
 of them began talking to him very affectionately on this wise:
 <milestone id="p04080011" /><q direct="unspecified">My son, thou art now almost grown up; 'twere well thou shouldst
 now begin to learn something for thyself of thy own affairs: wherefore
 we should be very well pleased if thou wert to go stay at Paris
 a while, where thou wilt see how we trade with not a little of thy
 wealth, besides which thou wilt there become a much better, finer,
 and more complete gentleman than thou couldst here, and when
 thou hast seen the lords and barons and seigneurs that are there in
 plenty, and hast acquired their manners, thou canst return hither.</q>
 <milestone id="p04080012" />The boy listened attentively, and then answered shortly that he
 would have none of it, for he supposed he might remain at Florence
 as well as another. Whereupon the worthy men plied him with fresh
 argument, but were unable to elicit other answer from him, and
 told his mother so. <milestone id="p04080013" />Whereat she was mightily incensed, and gave
 him a great scolding, not for his refusing to go to Paris, but for his
 love; which done, she plied him with soft, wheedling words, and
 <pb n="315" />endearing expressions and gentle entreaties that he would be pleased
 to do as his guardians would have him; whereby at length she prevailed
 so far, that he consented to go to Paris for a year and no more;
 and so 'twas arranged. <milestone id="p04080014" />To Paris accordingly our ardent lover went,
 and there under one pretext or another was kept for two years. He
 returned more in love than ever, to find his Salvestra married to a
 good youth that was a tent-maker; whereat his mortification knew
 no bounds. <milestone id="p04080015" />But, seeing that what must be must be, he sought to
 compose his mind; and, having got to know where she lived, he
 took to crossing her path, according to the wont of young men in
 love, thinking that she could no more have forgotten him than he
 her. 'Twas otherwise, however; she remembered him no more
 than if she had never seen him; or, if she had any recollection of
 him, she dissembled it: <milestone id="p04080016" />whereof the young man was very soon ware,
 to his extreme sorrow. Nevertheless he did all that he could to
 recall himself to her mind; but, as thereby he seemed to be nothing
 advantaged, he made up his mind, though he should die for it, to
 speak to her himself. <milestone id="p04080017" />So, being instructed as to her house by a neighbour,
 he entered it privily one evening when she and her husband
 were gone to spend the earlier hours with some neighbours, and hid
 himself in her room behind some tent-cloths that were stretched
 there, and waited till they were come back, and gone to bed, and he
 knew the husband to be asleep. Whereupon he got him to the
 place where he had seen Salvestra lie down, and said as he gently
 laid his hand upon her bosom: <q direct="unspecified">O my soul, art thou yet asleep?</q>
 <milestone id="p04080018" />The girl was awake, and was on the point of uttering a cry, when
 he forestalled her, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Hush! for God's sake. I am thy
 Girolamo.</q> 
<milestone id="p04080019" />Whereupon she, trembling in every limb: <q direct="unspecified">Nay, but
 for God's sake, Girolamo, begone: 'tis past, the time of our childhood,
 when our love was excusable. Thou seest I am married;
 wherefore 'tis no longer seemly that I should care for any other man
 than my husband, <milestone id="p04080020" />and so by the one God, I pray thee, begone; for,
 if my husband were to know that thou art here, the least evil that
 could ensue would be that I should never more be able to live with
 him in peace or comfort, whereas, having his love, I now pass my
 days with him in tranquil happiness.</q> 
<milestone id="p04080021" />Which speech caused the
 young man grievous distress; but 'twas in vain that he reminded
 her of the past, and of his love that distance had not impaired, and
 therewith mingled many a prayer and the mightiest protestations.
 <pb n="316" />
<milestone id="p04080022" />Wherefore, yearning for death, he besought her at last that she would
 suffer him to lie a while beside her till he got some heat, for he was
 chilled through and through, waiting for her, and promised her that
 he would say never a word to her, nor touch her, and that as soon
 as he was a little warmed he would go away. 
<milestone id="p04080023" />On which terms
 Salvestra, being not without pity for him, granted his request. So
 the young man lay down beside her, and touched her not; but,
 gathering up into one thought the love he had so long borne her,
 the harshness with which she now requited it, and his ruined hopes,
 resolved to live no longer, and in a convulsion, without a word, and
 with fists clenched, expired by her side.</p><p><milestone id="p04080024" />After a while the girl, marvelling at his continence, and fearing
 lest her husband should awake, broke silence, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Nay, but,
 Girolamo, why goest thou not?</q> 
<milestone id="p04080025" />But, receiving no answer, she
 supposed that he slept. Wherefore, reaching forth her hand to
 arouse him, she touched him and found him to her great surprise
 cold as ice; and touching him again and again somewhat rudely, and
 still finding that he did not stir, she knew that he was dead. Her
 grief was boundless, and 'twas long before she could bethink her how
 to act. <milestone id="p04080026" />But at last she resolved to sound her husband's mind as to
 what should be done in such a case without disclosing that 'twas his
 own. So she awakened him, and told him how he was then bested,
 as if it were the affair of another, and then asked him, if such a thing
 happened to her, what course he would take. 
<milestone id="p04080027" />The good man
 answered that he should deem it best to take the dead man privily
 home, and there leave him, bearing no grudge against the lady, who
 seemed to have done no wrong. 
<milestone id="p04080028" /><q direct="unspecified">And even so,</q> said his wife, <q direct="unspecified">it
 is for us to do;</q> and taking his hand, she laid it on the corpse.
 Whereat he started up in consternation, and struck a light, and without
 further parley with his wife, clapped the dead man's clothes
 upon him, and forthwith (confident in his own innocence) raised
 him on his shoulders, and bore him to the door of his house, where
 he set him down and left him.</p><p><milestone id="p04080029" />Day came, and the dead man being found before his own door,
 there was a great stir made, particularly by his mother; the body
 was examined with all care from head to foot, and, no wound or trace
 of violence being found on it, the physicians were on the whole of
 opinion that, as the fact was, the man had died of grief. So the corpse
 was borne to a church, and thither came the sorrowing mother and
 <pb n="317" />other ladies, her kinswomen and neighbours, and began to wail and
 mourn over it without restraint after our Florentine fashion. 
<milestone id="p04080030" />And
 when the wailing had reached its height, the good man, in whose
 house the death had occurred, said to Salvestra: <q direct="unspecified">Go wrap a
 mantle about thy head, and hie thee to the church, whither Girolamo
 has been taken, and go about among the women and list what
 they say of this matter, and I will do the like among the men, that
 we may hear if aught be said to our disadvantage.</q> 
<milestone id="p04080031" />The girl
 assented, for with tardy tenderness she now yearned to look on him
 dead, whom living she would not solace with a single kiss, and so to
 the church she went. <milestone id="p04080032" />Ah! how marvellous to whoso ponders it, is
 the might of Love, and how unsearchable his ways! That heart,
 which, while Fortune smiled on Girolamo, had remained sealed to
 him, opened to him now that he was fordone, and, kindling anew
 with all its old flame, melted with such compassion that no sooner
 saw she his dead face, as there she stood wrapped in her mantle,
 than, edging her way forward through the crowd of women, she
 stayed not till she was beside the corpse; and there, uttering a piercing
 shriek, she threw herself upon the dead youth, and as her face
 met his, and before she might drench it with her tears, grief that had
 reft life from him had even so reft it from her.</p><p><milestone id="p04080033" />The women strove to comfort her, and bade her raise herself a
 little, for as yet they knew her not; then, as she did not arise, they
 would have helped her, but found her stiff and stark, and so, raising
 her up, they in one and the same moment saw her to be Salvestra
 and dead. Whereat all the women that were there, overborne by
 a redoubled pity, broke forth in wailing new and louder far than
 before. <milestone id="p04080034" />From the church the bruit spread itself among the men,
 and reached the ears of Salvestra's husband, who, deaf to all that
 offered comfort or consolation, wept a long while; after which he
 told to not a few that were there what had passed in the night
 between the youth and his wife; and so 'twas known of all how
 they came to die, to the common sorrow of all. 
<milestone id="p04080035" />So they took the
 dead girl, and arrayed her as they are wont to array the dead, and
 laid her on the same bed beside the youth, and long time they
 mourned her: then were they both buried in the same tomb, and
 thus those, whom love had not been able to wed in life, were wedded
 by death in indissoluble union.</p></div2><pb n="318" /><div2 type="novella" who="filostrato" id="nov0409"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone id="p04090001" />Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon slays his wife's paramour,

 were once in Provence two noble knights, each having castles and
 vassals under him, the one yclept Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon,
 and the other Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing;<note>Boccaccio writes
 Guardastagno, but the troubadour, Cabestaing, or
	Cabestany, is the hero of the story.</note> <milestone id="p04090005" />and being both
 most doughty warriors, they were as brothers, and went ever together,
 and bearing the same device, to tournament or joust, or
 other passage of arms. <milestone id="p04090006" />And, albeit each dwelt in his own castle,
 and the castles were ten good miles apart, it nevertheless came to
 pass that, Sieur Guillaume de Roussillon having a most lovely lady,
 and amorous withal, to wife, Sieur Guillaume de Cabestaing, for all
 they were such friends and comrades, became inordinately enamoured
 of the lady, who, by this, that, and the other sign that he gave,
 dis<pb n="319" />covered
 his passion, <milestone id="p04090007" />and knowing him for a most complete knight,
 was flattered, and returned it, insomuch that she yearned and burned
 for him above all else in the world, and waited only till he should
 make his suit to her, as before long he did; and so they met from
 time to time, and great was their love. <milestone id="p04090008" />Which intercourse they
 ordered with so little discretion that 'twas discovered by the husband,
 who was very wroth, insomuch that the great love which he bore to
 Cabestaing was changed into mortal enmity; and, dissembling it
 better than the lovers their love, he made his mind up to kill Cabestaing.
 <milestone id="p04090009" />Now it came to pass that, while Roussillon was in this
 frame, a great tourney was proclaimed in France, whereof Roussillon
 forthwith sent word to Cabestaing, and bade him to his castle, so he
 were minded to come, that there they might discuss whether (or no)
 to go to the tourney, and how. Cabestaing was overjoyed, and
 made answer that he would come to sup with him next day without
 fail. <milestone id="p04090010" />Which message being delivered, Roussillon wist that the
 time was come to slay Cabestaing. So next day he armed himself,
 and, attended by a few servants, took horse, and about a mile from
 his castle lay in ambush in a wood through which Cabestaing must
 needs pass. <milestone id="p04090011" />He waited some time, and then he saw Cabestaing
 approach unarmed with two servants behind, also unarmed, for he
 was without thought of peril on Roussillon's part. So Cabestaing
 came on to the place of Roussillon's choice, and then, fell and vengeful,
 Roussillon leapt forth lance in hand, and fell upon him, exclaiming:
 <q direct="unspecified">Thou art a dead man!</q> and the words were no sooner
 spoken than the lance was through Cabestaing's breast. 
<milestone id="p04090012" />Powerless
 either to defend himself or even utter a cry, Cabestaing fell to the
 ground, and soon expired. His servants waited not to see who had
 done the deed, but turned their horses' heads and fled with all speed
 to their lord's castle. <milestone id="p04090013" />Roussillon dismounted, opened Cabestaing's
 breast with a knife, and took out the heart with his own hands,
 wrapped it up in a banderole, and gave it to one of his servants to
 carry: he then bade none make bold to breathe a word of the affair,
 mounted his horse and rode back--'twas now night--to his castle.
 <milestone id="p04090014" />The lady, who had been told that Cabestaing was to come to supper
 that evening, and was all impatience till he should come, was greatly
 surprised to see her husband arrive without him. Wherefore:
 <q direct="unspecified">How is this, my lord?</q> said she. <q direct="unspecified">Why tarries Cabestaing?</q>
 <pb n="320" />
<milestone id="p04090015" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> answered her husband, <q direct="unspecified">I have tidings from him that he
 cannot be here until to-morrow:</q> whereat the lady was somewhat
 disconcerted.</p><p><milestone id="p04090016" />Having dismounted, Roussillon called the cook, and said to him:
 <q direct="unspecified">Here is a boar's heart; take it, and make thereof the daintiest
 and most delicious dish thou canst, and when I am set at table serve
 it in a silver porringer.</q> So the cook took the heart, and expended
 all his skill and pains upon it, mincing it and mixing with it plenty
 of good seasoning, and made thereof an excellent ragout; 
<milestone id="p04090017" />and in due
 time Sieur Guillaume and his lady sat them down to table. The
 meat was served, but Sieur Guillaume, his mind engrossed with his
 crime, ate but little. The cook set the ragout before him, but he,
 feigning that he cared to eat no more that evening, had it passed on
 to the lady, and highly commended it. The lady, nothing loath,
 took some of it, and found it so good that she ended by eating the
 whole. <milestone id="p04090018" />Whereupon: <q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> quoth the knight, <q direct="unspecified">how liked
 you this dish?</q> 
<milestone id="p04090019" /><q direct="unspecified">In good faith, my lord,</q> replied the lady, <q direct="unspecified">not
 a little.</q> 
<milestone id="p04090020" /><q direct="unspecified">So help me, God,</q> returned the knight, <q direct="unspecified">I dare be
 sworn you did; 'tis no wonder that you should enjoy that dead, which
 living you enjoyed more than aught else in the world.</q> 
<milestone id="p04090021" />For a while
 the lady was silent; then: <q direct="unspecified">How say you?</q> said she; <q direct="unspecified">what is
 this you have caused me to eat?</q> 
<milestone id="p04090022" /><q direct="unspecified">That which you have eaten,</q>
 replied the knight, <q direct="unspecified">was in good sooth the heart of Sieur Guillaume
 de Cabestaing, whom you, disloyal woman that you are, did so much
 love: for assurance whereof I tell you that but a short while before
 I came back, I plucked it from his breast with my own hands.</q> 
<milestone id="p04090023" />It
 boots not to ask if the lady was sorrow-stricken to receive such tidings
 of her best beloved. But after a while she said: <q direct="unspecified">'Twas the deed
 of a disloyal and recreant knight; for if I, unconstrained by him, made
 him lord of my love, and thereby did you wrong, 'twas I, not he,
 should have borne the penalty. But God forbid that fare of such
 high excellence as the heart of a knight so true and courteous as Sieur
 Guillaume de Cabestaing be followed by aught else.</q> 
<milestone id="p04090024" />So saying she
 started to her feet, and stepping back to a window that was behind
 her, without a moment's hesitation let herself drop backwards
 therefrom. The window was at a great height from the ground, so
 that the lady was not only killed by the fall, but almost reduced to
 atoms. Stunned and conscience-stricken by the spectacle, and fear<pb n="321" />ing
 the vengeance of the country folk, and the Count of Provence,
 Sieur Guillaume had his horses saddled and rode away. 
<milestone id="p04090025" />On the
 morrow the whole countryside knew how the affair had come about;
 wherefore folk from both of the castles took the two bodies, and bore
 them with grief and lamentation exceeding great to the church in the

 since there dwelt at Salerno a leech most eminent in surgery, his
 name, Master Mazzeo della Montagna, who in his extreme old age
 took to wife a fair damsel of the same city, whom he kept in nobler
 and richer array of dresses and jewels, and all other finery that the
 sex affects, than any other lady in Salerno. Howbeit, she was none
 too warm most of her time, being ill covered abed by the doctor;
 <pb n="323" />
<milestone id="p04100005" />who gave her to understand--even as Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica,
 of whom we spoke a while since, taught his lady the feasts--that for
 once that a man lay with a woman he needed I know not how
 many days to recover, and the like nonsense: whereby she lived as
 ill content as might be; <milestone id="p04100006" />and, lacking neither sense nor spirit, she
 determined to economize at home, and taking to the street, to live
 at others' expense. So, having passed in review divers young men,
 she at last found one that was to her mind, on whom she set all her
 heart and hopes of happiness. Which the gallant perceiving was
 mightily flattered, and in like manner gave her all his love. 
<milestone id="p04100007" />Ruggieri
 da Jeroli--such was the gallant's name--was of noble birth, but of
 life and conversation so evil and reprehensible that kinsman or
 friend he had none left that wished him well, or cared to see him;
 and all Salerno knew him for a common thief and rogue of the vilest
 character. Whereof the lady took little heed, having a mind to him
 for another reason; and so with the help of her maid she arranged
 a meeting with him. <milestone id="p04100008" />But after they had solaced themselves a while,
 the lady began to censure his past life, and to implore him for love
 of her to depart from such evil ways; and to afford him the means
 thereto, she from time to time furnished him with money. 
<milestone id="p04100009" />While
 thus with all discretion they continued their intercourse, it chanced
 that a man halt of one of his legs was placed under the leech's care.
 The leech saw what was amiss with him, and told his kinsfolk, that,
 unless a gangrened bone that he had in his leg were taken out, he
 must die, or have the whole leg amputated; that if the bone were
 removed he might recover; but that otherwise he would not answer
 for his life: whereupon the relatives assented that the bone should
 be removed, and left the patient in the hands of the leech; 
<milestone id="p04100010" />who,
 deeming that by reason of the pain 'twas not possible for him to
 endure the treatment without an opiate, caused to be distilled in the
 morning a certain water of his own concoction, whereby the patient,
 drinking it, might be ensured sleep during such time as he deemed
 the operation, which he meant to perform about vespers, would
 occupy. In the meantime he had the water brought into his house,
 and set it in the window of his room, telling no one what it was.
 <milestone id="p04100011" />But when the vesper hour was come, and the leech was about to
 visit his patient, a messenger arrived from some very great friends of
 his at Amalfi, bearing tidings of a great riot there had been there, in
 <pb n="324" />which not a few had been wounded, and bidding him on no account
 omit to hie him thither forthwith. 
<milestone id="p04100012" />Wherefore the leech put off
 the treatment of the leg to the morrow, and took boat to Amalfi;
 and the lady, knowing that he would not return home that night,
 did as she was wont in such a case, to wit, brought Ruggieri in
 privily, and locked him in her chamber until certain other folk that
 were in the house were gone to sleep. <milestone id="p04100013" />Ruggieri, then, being thus in
 the chamber, awaiting the lady, and having--whether it were that
 he had had a fatiguing day, or eaten something salt, or, perchance,
 that 'twas his habit of body--a mighty thirst, glancing at the window,
 caught sight of the bottle containing the water which the leech had
 prepared for the patient, and taking it to be drinking water, set it
 to his lips and drank it all, and in no long time fell into a deep
 sleep.</p><p><milestone id="p04100014" />So soon as she was able the lady hied her to the room, and there
 finding Ruggieri asleep, touched him and softly told him to get up:
 to no purpose, however; he neither answered nor stirred a limb.
 Wherefore the lady, rather losing patience, applied somewhat more
 force, and gave him a push, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Get up, sleepy-head; if
 thou hadst a mind to sleep, thou shouldst have gone home, and not
 have come hither.</q> <milestone id="p04100015" />Thus pushed Ruggieri fell down from a box
 on which he lay, and, falling, shewed no more sign of animation
 than if he had been a corpse. The lady, now somewhat alarmed,
 essayed to lift him, and shook him roughly, and took him by the nose,
 and pulled him by the beard; again to no purpose: he had tethered
 his ass to a stout pin. <milestone id="p04100016" />So the lady began to fear he must be dead:
 however, she went on to pinch him shrewdly, and singe him with the
 flame of a candle; but when these methods also failed she, being, for
 all she was a leech's wife, no leech herself, believed for sure that he
 was dead; and as there was nought in the world that she loved so
 much, it boots not to ask if she was sore distressed; wherefore
 silently, for she dared not lament aloud, she began to weep over him
 and bewail such a misadventure. <milestone id="p04100017" />But, after a while, fearing lest her
 loss should not be without a sequel of shame, she bethought her that
 she must contrive without delay to get the body out of the house;
 and standing in need of another's advice, she quietly summoned her
 maid, shewed her the mishap that had befallen her, and craved her
 counsel. Whereat the maid marvelled not a little; and she too fell
 <pb n="325" />to pulling Ruggieri this way and that, and pinching him, and, as she
 found no sign of life in him, concurred with her mistress that he was
 verily dead, and advised her to remove him from the house. 
<milestone id="p04100018" /><q direct="unspecified">And
 where,</q> said the lady, <q direct="unspecified">shall we put him, that to-morrow, when he
 is discovered, it be not suspected that 'twas hence he was carried?</q>
 <milestone id="p04100019" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> answered the maid, <q direct="unspecified">late last evening I marked in front
 of our neighbour the carpenter's shop a chest, not too large, which,
 if he have not put it back in the house, will come in very handy
 for our purpose, for we will put him inside, and give him two or
 three cuts with a knife, and so leave him. When he is found, I
 know not why it should be thought that 'twas from this house rather
 than from any other that he was put there; nay, as he was an evilliver,
 'twill more likely be supposed, that, as he hied him on some
 evil errand, some enemy slew him, and then put him in the chest.</q>
 <milestone id="p04100020" />The lady said there was nought in the world she might so ill brook
 as that Ruggieri should receive any wound; but with that exception
 she approved her maid's proposal, and sent her to see if the chest
 were still where she had seen it. The maid, returning, reported
 that there it was, and, being young and strong, got Ruggieri, with
 the lady's help, upon her shoulders; and so the lady, going before
 to espy if any folk came that way, and the maid following, they
 came to the chest, and having laid Ruggieri therein, closed it and
 left him there.</p><p><milestone id="p04100021" />Now a few days before, two young men, that were usurers, had
 taken up their quarters in a house a little further on: they had seen
 the chest during the day, and being short of furniture, and having
 a mind to make great gain with little expenditure, they had resolved
 that, if it were still there at night, they would take it home with
 them. <milestone id="p04100022" />So at midnight forth they hied them, and finding the chest,
 were at no pains to examine it closely, but forthwith, though it
 seemed somewhat heavy, bore it off to their house, and set it down
 beside a room in which their women slept; and without being at
 pains to adjust it too securely they left it there for the time, and
 went to bed.</p><p><milestone id="p04100023" />Towards matins Ruggieri, having had a long sleep and digested
 the draught and exhausted its efficacy, awoke, but albeit his slumber
 was broken, and his senses had recovered their powers, yet his brain
 remained in a sort of torpor which kept him bemused for some days;
 <pb n="326" />and when he opened his eyes and saw nothing, and stretched his
 hands hither and thither and found himself in the chest, it was with
 difficulty that he collected his thoughts. 
<milestone id="p04100024" /><q direct="unspecified">How is this?</q> he said to
 himself. <q direct="unspecified">Where am I? Do I sleep or wake? I remember
 coming this evening to my lady's chamber; and now it seems I am
 in a chest. What means it? Can the leech have returned, or
 somewhat else have happened that caused the lady, while I slept, to
 hide me here? That was it, I suppose. Without a doubt it must
 have been so.</q> 
<milestone id="p04100025" />And having come to this conclusion, he composed
 himself to listen, if haply he might hear something, and being somewhat
 ill at ease in the chest, which was none too large, and the side
 on which he lay paining him, he must needs turn over to the other,
 and did so with such adroitness that, bringing his loins smartly
 against one of the sides of the chest, which was set on an uneven
 floor, he caused it to tilt and then fall; and such was the noise that
 it made as it fell that the women that slept there awoke, albeit for
 fear they kept silence. <milestone id="p04100026" />Ruggieri was not a little disconcerted by the
 fall, but, finding that thereby the chest was come open, he judged
 that, happen what might, he would be better out of it than in it;
 and not knowing where he was, and being otherwise at his wits' end,
 he began to grope about the house, if haply he might find a stair or
 door whereby he might take himself off. <milestone id="p04100027" />Hearing him thus groping
 his way, the alarmed women gave tongue with: <q direct="unspecified">Who is there?</q>
 Ruggieri, not knowing the voice, made no answer: wherefore the
 women fell to calling the two young men, who, having had a long
 day, were fast asleep, and heard nought of what went on. 
<milestone id="p04100028" />Which
 served to increase the fright of the women, who rose and got them
 to divers windows, and raised the cry: <q direct="unspecified">Take thief, take thief!</q>
 At which summons there came running from divers quarters not a
 few of the neighbours, who got into the house by the roof or otherwise
 as each best might: likewise the young men, aroused by the
 din, got up; <milestone id="p04100029" />and, Ruggieri being now all but beside himself for sheer
 amazement, and knowing not whither to turn him to escape them,
 they took him and delivered him to the officers of the Governor of
 the city, who, hearing the uproar, had hasted to the spot. And so
 he was brought before the Governor, who, knowing him to be held
 of all a most arrant evil-doer, put him forthwith to the torture, and,
 upon his confessing that he had entered the house of the usurers with
 <pb n="327" />intent to rob, was minded to make short work of it, and have him
 hanged by the neck.</p><p><milestone id="p04100030" />In the morning 'twas bruited throughout all Salerno that
 Ruggieri had been taken a thieving in the house of the usurers.
 Whereat the lady and her maid were all amazement and bewilderment,
 insomuch that they were within an ace of persuading themselves
 that what they had done the night before they had not done,
 but had only dreamed it; besides which, the peril in which Ruggieri
 stood caused the lady such anxiety as brought her to the verge
 of madness. <milestone id="p04100031" />Shortly after half tierce the leech, being returned
 from Amalfi, and minded now to treat his patient, called for his
 water, and finding the bottle empty made a great commotion, protesting
 that nought in his house could be let alone. <milestone id="p04100032" />The lady,
 having other cause of annoy, lost temper, and said: <q direct="unspecified">What would
 you say, Master, of an important matter, when you raise such a din
 because a bottle of water has been upset? Is there never another to
 be found in the world?</q> 
<milestone id="p04100033" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> replied the leech, <q direct="unspecified">thou takest
 this to have been mere water: 'twas no such thing, but an artificial
 water of a soporiferous virtue;</q> and he told her for what purpose he
 had made it. <milestone id="p04100034" />Which the lady no sooner heard, than, guessing that
 Ruggieri had drunk it, and so had seemed to them to be dead, she
 said: <q direct="unspecified">Master, we knew it not; wherefore make you another.</q>
 And so the leech, seeing that there was no help for it, had another
 made. <milestone id="p04100035" />Not long after, the maid, who by the lady's command had
 gone to find out what folk said of Ruggieri, returned, saying:
 <q direct="unspecified">Madam, of Ruggieri they say nought but evil, nor, by what I have
 been able to discover, has he friend or kinsman that has or will come
 to his aid; and 'tis held for certain that to-morrow the Stadic<note>The
 Neapolitan term for the chief of police.</note> will
 have him hanged. <milestone id="p04100036" />Besides which, I have that to tell you which will
 surprise you; for, methinks, I have found out how he came into the
 usurers' house. List, then, how it was: you know the carpenter in
 front of whose shop stood the chest we put Ruggieri into: he had
 to-day the most violent altercation in the world with one to whom
 it would seem the chest belongs, by whom he was required to make
 good the value of the chest, to which he made answer that he had
 not sold it, but that it had been stolen from him in the night. 
<milestone id="p04100037" />'Not
 <pb n="328" />so,' said the other; 'thou soldst it to the two young usurers, as they
 themselves told me last night, when I saw it in their house at the
 time Ruggieri was taken.' 'They lie,' replied the carpenter. 'I
 never sold it them, but they must have stolen it from me last night;
 go we to them.' <milestone id="p04100038" />So with one accord off they went to the usurers'
 house, and I came back here. And so, you see, I make out that
 'twas on such wise that Ruggieri was brought where he was found;
 but how he came to life again, I am at a loss to conjecture.</q> 
<milestone id="p04100039" />The lady
 now understood exactly how things were, and accordingly told the
 maid what she had learned from the leech, and besought her to aid
 her to get Ruggieri off, for so she might, if she would, and at the
 same time preserve her honour. <milestone id="p04100040" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> said the maid, <q direct="unspecified">do but
 shew me how; and glad shall I be to do just as you wish.</q> 
<milestone id="p04100041" />Whereupon
 the lady, to whom necessity taught invention, formed her plan
 on the spur of the moment, and expounded it in detail to the maid;
 <milestone id="p04100042" />who (as the first step) hied her to the leech, and, weeping, thus
 addressed him: <q direct="unspecified">Sir, it behoves me to ask your pardon of a great
 wrong that I have done you.</q> 
<milestone id="p04100043" /><q direct="unspecified">And what may that be?</q> inquired the leech. 
<milestone id="p04100044" /><q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> said the maid, who ceased not to weep, <q direct="unspecified">you
 know what manner of man is Ruggieri da Jeroli. Now he took a
 fancy to me, and partly for fear, partly for love, I this year agreed to
 be his mistress; and knowing yestereve that you were from home,
 he coaxed me into bringing him into your house to sleep with me in
 my room. Now he was athirst, and I, having no mind to be seen
 by your lady, who was in the hall, and knowing not whither I might
 sooner betake me for wine or water, bethought me that I had seen a
 bottle of water in your room, and ran and fetched it, and gave it him
 to drink, and then put the bottle back in the place whence I had
 taken it; touching which I find that you have made a great stir in
 the house. <milestone id="p04100045" />Verily I confess that I did wrong; but who is there
 that does not wrong sometimes? Sorry indeed am I to have so done,
 but 'tis not for such a cause and that which ensued thereon that
 Ruggieri should lose his life. Wherefore, I do most earnestly
 beseech you, pardon me, and suffer me to go help him as best I may
 be able.</q> 
<milestone id="p04100046" />Wroth though he was at what he heard, the leech replied
 in a bantering tone: <q direct="unspecified">Thy pardon thou hast by thine own deed;
 for, whereas thou didst last night think to have with thee a gallant
 that would thoroughly dust thy pelisse for thee, he was but a
 sleepy<pb n="329" />head;
 wherefore get thee gone, and do what thou mayst for the
 deliverance of thy lover, and for the future look thou bring him not
 into the house; else I will pay thee for that turn and this to boot.</q>
 <milestone id="p04100047" />The maid, deeming that she had come off well in the first brush,
 hied her with all speed to the prison where Ruggieri lay, and by her
 cajoleries prevailed upon the warders to let her speak with him; and
 having told him how he must answer the Stadic if he would get off,
 she succeeded in obtaining preaudience of the Stadic; 
<milestone id="p04100048" />who, seeing
 that the baggage was lusty and mettlesome, was minded before he
 heard her to grapple her with the hook, to which she was by no
 means averse, knowing that such a preliminary would secure her a
 better hearing. When she had undergone the operation and was
 risen: <q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> said she, <q direct="unspecified">you have here Ruggieri da Jeroli,
 apprehended
 on a charge of theft; which charge is false.</q> 
<milestone id="p04100049" />Whereupon she
 told him the whole story from beginning to end, how she, being
 Ruggieri's mistress, had brought him into the leech's house and had
 given him the opiate, not knowing it for such, and taking him to be
 dead, had put him in the chest; and then recounting what she had
 heard pass between the carpenter and the owner of the chest, she
 shewed him how Ruggieri came into the house of the usurers.
 <milestone id="p04100050" />Seeing that 'twas easy enough to find out whether the story were
 true, the Stadic began by questioning the leech as to the water, and
 found that 'twas as she had said: he then summoned the carpenter,
 the owner of the chest and the usurers, and after much further
 parley ascertained that the usurers had stolen the chest during the
 night, and brought it into their house: <milestone id="p04100051" />finally he sent for Ruggieri,
 and asked him where he had lodged that night, to which Ruggieri
 answered that where he had lodged he knew not, but he well
 remembered going to pass the night with Master Mazzeo's maid, in
 whose room he had drunk some water by reason of a great thirst
 that he had; but what happened to him afterwards, except that, when
 he awoke, he found himself in a chest in the house of the usurers, he
 knew not. <milestone id="p04100052" />All which matters the Stadic heard with great interest,
 and caused the maid and Ruggieri and the carpenter and the
 usurers to rehearse them several times. <milestone id="p04100053" />In the end, seeing that
 Ruggieri was innocent, he released him, and mulcted the usurers in
 fifteen ounces for the theft of the chest. How glad Ruggieri was
 thus to escape, it boots not to ask; and glad beyond measure was his
 <pb n="330" />lady. And so, many a time did they laugh and make merry
 together over the affair, she and he and the dear maid that had
 proposed to give him a taste of the knife; and remaining constant in
 their love, they had ever better and better solace thereof. The like
 whereof befall me, sans the being put in the chest.</p></div2><div2 type="conclusion" who="author" id="d04conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone id="p04970001" />Heartsore as the gentle ladies had been made by the preceding
 stories, this last of Dioneo provoked them to such merriment, more
 especially the passage about the Stadic and the hook, that they lacked
 not relief of the piteous mood engendered by the others. 
<milestone id="p04970002" />But the
 king observing that the sun was now taking a yellowish tinge, and
 that the end of his sovereignty was come, in terms most courtly
 made his excuse to the fair ladies, that he had made so direful a
 theme as lovers' infelicity the topic of their discourse; after which,
 he rose, took the laurel wreath from his head, and, while the ladies
 watched to see to whom he would give it, set it graciously upon the
 blond head of Fiammetta, saying: 
<milestone id="p04970003" /><q direct="unspecified">Herewith I crown thee, as
 deeming that thou, better than any other, wilt know how to make
 to-morrow console our fair companions for the rude trials of to-day.</q>
 <milestone id="p04970004" />Fiammetta, whose wavy tresses fell in a flood of gold over her white
 and delicate shoulders, whose softly rounded face was all radiant
 with the very tints of the white lily blended with the red of the
 rose, who carried two eyes in her head that matched those of a
 peregrine falcon, while her tiny sweet mouth shewed a pair of lips
 that shone as rubies, replied with a smile: 
<milestone id="p04970005" /><q direct="unspecified">And gladly take I the
 wreath, Filostrato, and that thou mayst more truly understand what
 thou hast done, 'tis my present will and pleasure that each make
	ready to discourse to-morrow of <seg type="topic">good fortune befalling lovers after
 divers direful or disastrous adventures</seg>.</q> 
<milestone id="p04970006" />The theme propounded was
 approved by all; whereupon the queen called the seneschal, and
 having made with him all meet arrangements, rose and gaily dismissed
 all the company until the supper hour; <milestone id="p04970007" />wherefore, some
 straying about the garden, the beauties of which were not such
 as soon to pall, others bending their steps towards the mills that
 were grinding without, each, as and where it seemed best, they took
 meanwhile their several pleasures. <milestone id="p04970008" />The supper hour come, they all
 gathered, in their wonted order, by the fair fountain, and in the
 gayest of spirits and well served they supped. Then rising they
 addressed them, as was their wont, to dance and song, and while
 <pb n="331" />Filomena led the dance: 
<milestone id="p04970009" /><q direct="unspecified">Filostrato,</q> said the queen, <q direct="unspecified">being
 minded to follow in the footsteps of our predecessors, and that, as
 by their, so by our command a song be sung; and well witting that
 thy songs are even as thy stories, to the end that no day but this be
 vexed with thy misfortunes, we ordain that thou give us one of
 them, whichever thou mayst prefer.</q> 
<milestone id="p04970010" />Filostrato answered that he
 would gladly do so; and without delay began to sing on this wise:</p><div3 who="filostrato" type="song"><lg><milestone id="p04970011" />

	<l>Myself her vassal lowliest and most graced,</l>
	<l>Nor thought Love might bereave,</l>

      by the words of this song; and perchance they had been made still
      more so by the looks of a lady that was among the dancers, had not
      the shades of night, which had now overtaken them, concealed the
      blush that suffused her face. Other songs followed until the hour
      for slumber arrived: whereupon at the behest of the queen all the
      ladies sought their several chambers.</p></div2></div1>
