 and the birds, blithely chanting their lays among the green boughs,
 carried the tidings to the ear, when with one accord all the ladies and
 the three young men arose, and entered the gardens, where for no

 to raise a laugh at others' expense, especially in regard of things
 worthy to be had in reverence, has found the laugh turn against himself,
 and sometimes to his loss: as, in obedience to the queen's
 command, and by way of introducing our theme, I am about to shew
 you, by the narrative of an adventure which befell one of our own
 citizens, and after a course of evil fortune had an entirely unexpected
 and very felicitous issue.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02010003" />Not long ago there was at Treviso a German, named Arrigo, a
 poor man who got his living as a common hired porter, but, though
 of so humble a condition, was respected by all, being accounted not
      only an honest but a most holy man; <milestone id="p02010004" />insomuch that, whether truly
 or falsely I know not, the Trevisans affirm, that on his decease all
 the bells of the cathedral of Treviso began to toll of their own accord.
 <milestone id="p02010005" />Which being accounted a miracle, this Arrigo was generally reputed
 a saint; and all the people of the city gathered before the house where
 his body lay, and bore it, with a saint's honours, into the cathedral,
 and brought thither the halt and paralytic and blind, and others
 afflicted with disease or bodily defects, as hoping that by contact with
 this holy body they would all be healed. <milestone id="p02010006" />The people thus tumultuously
 thronging the church, it so chanced that there arrived in
 Treviso three of our own citizens, of whom one was named Stecchi,
 another Martellino, and the third Marchese; all three being men
 <pb n="69" />whose habit it was to frequent the courts of the nobles and afford
 spectators amusement by assuming disguises and personating other
 men. Being entire strangers to the place, and seeing everybody
 running to and fro, they were much astonished, and having learned
 the why and wherefore, were curious to go see what was to be seen.
 <milestone id="p02010007" />So at the inn, where they put up, Marchese began: <q direct="unspecified">We would
 fain go see this saint; but for my part I know not how we are to
 reach the spot, for I hear the piazza is full of Germans and other
 armed men, posted there by the Lord who rules here to prevent an
 uproar, and moreover the church, so far as one may learn, is so full
 of folk that scarce another soul may enter it.</q> 
<milestone id="p02010008" />Whereupon Martellino,
 who was bent on seeing what was to be seen, said: <q direct="unspecified">Let not
 this deter us; I will assuredly find a way of getting to the saint's
 body.</q>
 <milestone id="p02010009" /><q direct="unspecified">How?</q> rejoined Marchese. 
<milestone id="p02010010" /><q direct="unspecified">I will tell you,</q> replied Martellino;
 <q direct="unspecified">I will counterfeit a paralytic, and thou wilt support me on one side
 and Stecchi on the other, as if I were not able to go alone, and so
 you will enter the church, making it appear as if you were leading
 me up to the body of the saint that he may heal me, and all that see
 will make way and give us free passage.</q> 
<milestone id="p02010011" />Marchese and Stecchi
 approved the plan; so all three forthwith left the inn and repaired to
 a lonely place, where Martellino distorted his hands, his fingers, his
 arms, his legs, and also his mouth and eyes and his entire face in a
 manner horrible to contemplate; so that no stranger that saw him
 could have doubted that he was impotent and paralysed in every part
 of his body. <milestone id="p02010012" />In this guise Marchese and Stecchi laid hold of him,
 and led him towards the church, assuming a most piteous air, and
 humbly beseeching everybody for God's sake to make way for them.
 Their request was readily granted; and, in short, observed by all,
 and crying out at almost every step, <q direct="unspecified">make way, make way,</q> they
 reached the place where St. Arrigo's body was laid. Whereupon
 some gentlemen who stood by hoisted Martellino on to the saint's
 body, that thereby he might receive the boon of health. <milestone id="p02010013" />There he
 lay still for a while, the eyes of all in the church being riveted upon
 him in expectation of the result; then, being a very practised performer,
 he stretched, first, one of his fingers, next a hand, afterwards
 an arm, and so forth, making as if he gradually recovered the use of
 all his natural powers. Which the people observing raised such a
 clamour in honour of St. Arrigo that even thunder would have been
 <pb n="70" />inaudible.
 <milestone id="p02010014" />Now it chanced that hard by stood a Florentine, who
 knew Martellino well, though he had failed to recognise him, when,
 in such strange guise, he was led into the church; but now, seeing
 him resume his natural shape, the Florentine recognised him, and at
 once said with a laugh: <q direct="unspecified">God's curse upon him. Who that saw
 him come but would have believed that he was really paralysed?</q>
 <milestone id="p02010015" />These words were overheard by some of the Trevisans, who began
 forthwith to question the Florentine. <q direct="unspecified">How?</q> said they; <q direct="unspecified">was
 he then not paralysed?</q> 
<milestone id="p02010016" /><q direct="unspecified">No, by God!</q> returned the Florentine;
 <q direct="unspecified">he has always been as straight as any of us; he has merely
 shewn you that he knows better than any man alive how to play
 this trick of putting on any counterfeit semblance that he chooses.</q>
 <milestone id="p02010017" />Thereupon the Trevisans, without further parley, made a rush, clearing
 the way and crying out as they went: <q direct="unspecified">Seize this traitor who
 mocks at God and His saints; who, being no paralytic, has come
 hither in the guise of a paralytic to deride our patron saint and us.</q>
 <milestone id="p02010018" />So saying, they laid hands on him, dragged him down from where
 he stood, seized him by the hair, tore the clothes from his back, and
 fell to beating and kicking him, so that it seemed to him as if all the
 world were upon him. <milestone id="p02010019" />He cried out: <q direct="unspecified">Pity, for God's sake,</q> and
 defended himself as best he could: all in vain, however; the press
 became thicker and thicker moment by moment. <milestone id="p02010020" />Which Stecchi and
 Marchese observing began to say one to the other that 'twas a bad
 business; yet, being apprehensive on their own account, they did not
 venture to come to his assistance, but cried out with the rest that he
 ought to die, at the same time, however, casting about how they
 might find the means to rescue him from the hands of the people,
 who would certainly have killed him, but for a diversion which
 Marchese hastily effected. <milestone id="p02010021" />The entire posse of the signory being just
 outside, he ran off at full speed to the Podest&#224;'s lieutenant, and
 said
 to him: <q direct="unspecified">Help, for God's sake; there is a villain here that has cut
 my purse with full a hundred florins of gold in it; prithee have him
 arrested that I may have my own again.</q> <milestone id="p02010022" />Whereupon, twelve
 sergeants or more ran forthwith to the place where hapless Martellino
 was being carded without a comb, and, forcing their way with the
 utmost difficulty through the throng, rescued him all bruised and
 battered from their hands, and led him to the palace; whither he was
 followed by many who, resenting what he had done, and hearing that
 <pb n="71" />he was arrested as a cutpurse, and lacking better pretext for harassing
 him, began one and all to charge him with having cut their purses.
 <milestone id="p02010023" />All which the deputy of the Podest&#224; had no sooner heard, than, being
 a harsh man, he straightway took Martellino aside and began to
 examine him. <milestone id="p02010024" />Martellino answered his questions in a bantering tone,
 making light of the arrest; whereat the deputy, losing patience, had
 him bound to the strappado, and caused him to receive a few hints of
 the cord with intent to extort from him a confession of his guilt, by
 way of preliminary to hanging him. <milestone id="p02010025" />Taken down from the strappado,
 and questioned by the deputy if what his accusers said were
 true, Martellino, as nothing was to be gained by denial, answered:
 <q direct="unspecified">My lord, I am ready to confess the truth; let but my accusers say,
 each of them, when and where I cut his purse, and I will tell you
 what I have and what I have not done.</q> 
<milestone id="p02010026" /><q direct="unspecified">So be it,</q> said the deputy,
 and caused a few of them to be summoned. Whereupon Martellino,
 being charged with having cut this, that or the other man's purse
 eight, six or four days ago, while others averred that he had cut their
 purses that very day, <milestone id="p02010027" />answered thus: <q direct="unspecified">My lord, these men lie in
 the throat, and for token that I speak true, I tell you that, so far from
 having been here as long as they make out, it is but very lately that
 I came into these parts, where I never was before; and no sooner was
 I come, than, as my ill-luck would have it, I went to see the body of
 this saint, and so have been carded as you see; and that what I say
 is true, his Lordship's intendant of arrivals, and his book, and also my
 host may certify. <milestone id="p02010028" />Wherefore, if you find that even so it is as I say,
 hearken not to these wicked men, and spare me the torture and death
 which they would have you inflict.</q> 
<milestone id="p02010029" />In this posture of affairs
 Marchese and Stecchi, learning that the Podest&#224;'s deputy was dealing
 rigorously with Martellino, and had already put him to the strappado,
 grew mightily alarmed. <q direct="unspecified">We have made a mess of it,</q> they said to
 themselves; <q direct="unspecified">we have only taken him out of the frying-pan to toss
 him into the fire.</q> 
<milestone id="p02010030" />So, hurrying hither and thither with the utmost
 zeal, they made diligent search until they found their host, and told
 him how matters stood. The host had his laugh over the affair, and
 then brought them to one Sandro Agolanti, who dwelt in Treviso
 and had great interest with the Lord of the place. The host laid the
 whole matter before Sandro, and, backed by Marchese and Stecchi,
 besought him to undertake Martellino's cause. <milestone id="p02010031" />Sandro, after many
 <pb n="72" />a hearty laugh, hied him to the Lord, who at his instance sent for
 Martellino. The messengers found Martellino still in his shirt before
 the deputy, at his wits' end, and all but beside himself with fear,
 because the deputy would hear nothing that he said in his defence.
 Indeed, the deputy, having a spite against Florentines, had quite
 made up his mind to have him hanged; he was therefore in the last
 degree reluctant to surrender him to the Lord, and only did so upon
 compulsion. <milestone id="p02010032" />Brought at length before the Lord, Martellino detailed
 to him the whole affair, and prayed him as the greatest of favours to
 let him depart in peace. <milestone id="p02010033" />The Lord had a hearty laugh over the
 adventure, and bestowed a tunic on each of the three. So, congratulating
 themselves on their unexpected deliverance from so great
 a peril, they returned home safe and sound.</p></div2><pb n="73" /><div2 type="novella" who="filostrato" id="nov0202"><head>Novel II</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02020001" />Rinaldo d'Asti is robbed, arrives at Castel Guglielmo,

	inordinately at Neifile's narrative of Martellino's misadventures.
	Then Filostrato, who sate next Neifile, received the queen's command
	to follow her, and promptly thus began:</p></div3><div3 who="filostrato" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p02020003" />Fair ladies, 'tis on my mind to tell you a story in which are
 mingled things sacred and passages of adverse fortune and love,
 which to hear will perchance be not unprofitable, more especially to
 travellers in love's treacherous lands; of whom if any fail to say St.
 Julian's paternoster, it often happens that, though he may have a
 good bed, he is ill lodged.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02020004" />Know, then, that in the time of the Marquis Azzo da Ferrara, a
 merchant, Rinaldo d'Asti by name, having disposed of certain affairs
 which had brought him to Bologna, set his face homeward, and
 having left Ferrara behind him was on his way to Verona, when he
 fell in with some men that looked like merchants, but were in truth
 robbers and men of evil life and condition, whose company he
      imprudently joined, riding and conversing with them. <milestone id="p02020005" />They, perceiving
 that he was a merchant, and judging that he must have
 money about him, complotted to rob him on the first opportunity;
 and to obviate suspicion they played the part of worthy and reputable
 men, their discourse of nought but what was seemly and honourable
 and leal, their demeanour at once as respectful and as cordial as they
 could make it; so that he deemed himself very lucky to have met
 with them, being otherwise alone save for a single mounted servant.
 <pb n="74" />
      <milestone id="p02020006" />Journeying
 thus, they conversed, after the desultory manner of travellers,
 of divers matters, until at last they fell a talking of the prayers which
 men address to God, and one of the robbers--there were three of
 them--said to Rinaldo: <q direct="unspecified">And you, gentle sir, what is your wonted
 orison when you are on your travels?</q> 
<milestone id="p02020007" />Rinaldo answered: <q direct="unspecified">Why,
 to tell the truth, I am a man unskilled, unlearned in such matters,
 and few prayers have I at my command, being one that lives in the
 good old way and lets two soldi count for twenty-four deniers;
 nevertheless it has always been my custom in journeying to say of a
 morning, as I leave the inn, a paternoster and an avemaria for the
 souls of the father and mother of St. Julian, after which I pray God
 and St. Julian to provide me with a good inn for the night. <milestone id="p02020008" />And
 many a time in the course of my life have I met with great perils by
 the way, and evading them all have found comfortable quarters for
 the night: whereby my faith is assured, that St. Julian, in whose
 honour I say my paternoster, has gotten me this favour of God; nor
 should I look for a prosperous journey and a safe arrival at night, if
 I had not said it in the morning.</q> 
<milestone id="p02020009" />Then said his interrogator:
 <q direct="unspecified">And did you say it this morning?</q> 
<milestone id="p02020010" />Whereto Rinaldo answered, <q direct="unspecified">Troth, did I,</q> 
<milestone id="p02020011" />which caused the other, who by this time knew
 what course matters would take, to say to himself: <q direct="unspecified">'Twill prove
 to have been said in the nick of time; for if we do not miscarry, I
 take it thou wilt have but a sorry lodging.</q> 
<milestone id="p02020012" />Then turning to
 Rinaldo he said: <q direct="unspecified">I also have travelled much, and never a prayer
 have I said, though I have heard them much commended by many;
 nor has it ever been my lot to find other than good quarters for the
 night; it may be that this very evening you will be able to determine
 which of us has the better lodging, you that have said the paternoster,
 or I that have not said it. True, however, it is that in its stead I
 am accustomed to say the 'Dirupisti,' or the 'Intemerata,' or the
 'De profundis,' which, if what my grandmother used to say is to be
 believed, are of the greatest efficacy.</q> 
<milestone id="p02020013" />So, talking of divers matters,
 and ever on the look-out for time and place suited to their evil
 purpose, they continued their journey, until towards evening, some
 distance from Castel Guglielmo, as they were about to ford a stream,
 these three ruffians, profiting by the lateness of the hour, and the
 loneliness and straitness of the place, set upon Rinaldo and robbed
 him, and leaving him afoot and in his shirt, said by way of adieu:
 <pb n="75" /><q direct="unspecified">Go now, and see if thy St. Julian will provide thee with good
 lodging to-night; our saint, we doubt not, will do as much by us;</q>
 and so crossing the stream, they went their way. <milestone id="p02020014" />Rinaldo's servant,
 coward that he was, did nothing to help his master when he saw him
 attacked, but turned his horse's head, and was off at a smart pace;
 nor did he draw rein until he was come to Castel Guglielmo; where,
 it being now evening, he put up at an inn and gave himself no
 further trouble. <milestone id="p02020015" />Rinaldo, left barefoot, and stripped to his shirt,
 while the night closed in very cold and snowy, was at his wits' end,
 and shivering so that his teeth chattered in his head, began to peer
 about, if haply he might find some shelter for the night, that so
 he might not perish with the cold; but, seeing none (for during a
 recent war the whole country had been wasted by fire), he set off for
 Castel Guglielmo, quickening his pace by reason of the cold.
 Whether his servant had taken refuge in Castel Guglielmo or
 elsewhere, he knew not, but he thought that, could he but enter
 the town, God would surely send him some succour. <milestone id="p02020016" />However,
 dark night overtook him while he was still about a mile from the
 castle; so that on his arrival he found the gates already locked and
 the bridges raised, and he could not pass in. <milestone id="p02020017" />Sick at heart, disconsolate
 and bewailing his evil fortune, he looked about for some
 place where he might ensconce himself, and at any rate find shelter
 from the snow. And by good luck he espied a house, built with a
 balcony a little above the castle-wall, under which balcony he
 purposed to shelter himself until daybreak. Arrived at the spot, he
 found beneath the balcony a postern, which, however, was locked;
 and having gathered some bits of straw that lay about, he placed
 them in front of the postern, and there in sad and sorrowful plight
 took up his quarters, with many a piteous appeal to St. Julian, whom
 he reproached for not better rewarding the faith which he reposed
 in him. <milestone id="p02020018" />St. Julian, however, had not abandoned him, and in due
 time provided him with a good lodging.</p><p><milestone id="p02020019" />There was in the castle a widow lady of extraordinary beauty
 (none fairer) whom Marquis Azzo loved as his own life, and kept
 there for his pleasure. She lived in the very same house beneath
 the balcony of which Rinaldo had posted himself. <milestone id="p02020020" />Now it chanced
 that that very day the Marquis had come to Castel Guglielmo to
 pass the night with her, and had privily caused a bath to be made
 <pb n="76" />ready, and a supper suited to his rank, in the lady's own house.
 The arrangements were complete; and only the Marquis was stayed
 for, when a servant happened to present himself at the castle-gate,
 bringing tidings for the Marquis which obliged him suddenly to take
 horse. He therefore sent word to the lady that she must not wait
 for him, and forthwith took his departure. <milestone id="p02020021" />The lady, somewhat
 disconsolate, found nothing better to do than to get into the bath
 which had been intended for the Marquis, sup and go to bed: so
 into the bath she went. <milestone id="p02020022" />The bath was close to the postern on the
 other side of which hapless Rinaldo had ensconced himself, and thus
 the mournful and quavering music which Rinaldo made as he
 shuddered in the cold, and which seemed rather to proceed from a
 stork's beak than from the mouth of a human being, was audible to
 the lady in the bath. She therefore called her maid, and said to
 her: <q direct="unspecified">Go up and look out over the wall and down at the postern,
 and mark who is there, and what he is, and what he does there.</q>
 <milestone id="p02020023" />The maid obeyed, and, the night being fine, had no difficulty in
 making out Rinaldo as he sate there, barefoot, as I have said, and in
 his shirt, and trembling in every limb. So she called out to him,
 to know who he was. <milestone id="p02020024" />Rinaldo, who could scarcely articulate for
 shivering, told as briefly as he could, who he was, and how and why
 he came to be there; which done, he began piteously to beseech
 her not, if she could avoid it, to leave him there all night to perish of
 cold. <milestone id="p02020025" />The maid went back to her mistress full of pity for Rinaldo,
 and told her all she had seen and heard. The lady felt no less pity
 for Rinaldo; and bethinking her that she had the key of the postern
 by which the Marquis sometimes entered when he paid her a secret
 visit, she said to the maid: <q direct="unspecified">Go, and let him in softly; here is
 this supper, and there will be none to eat it; and we can very well
 put him up for the night.</q> 
<milestone id="p02020026" />Cordially commending her mistress's
 humanity, the maid went and let Rinaldo in, and brought him to the
 lady, who, seeing that he was all but dead with cold, said to him:
 <q direct="unspecified">Quick, good man, get into that bath, which is still warm.</q>
 <milestone id="p02020027" />Gladly he did so, awaiting no second invitation, and was so much
 comforted by its warmth that he seemed to have passed from death
 to life. The lady provided him with a suit of clothes, which
 had been worn by her husband shortly before his death, and which,
 when he had them on, looked as if they had been made for him. So
 <pb n="77" />he recovered heart, and, while he awaited the lady's commands, gave
 thanks to God and St. Julian for delivering him from a woful night
 and conducting him, as it seemed, to comfortable quarters.</p><p><milestone id="p02020028" />The lady meanwhile took a little rest, after which she had a
 roaring fire put in one of her large rooms, whither presently she
 came, and asked her maid how the good man did. <milestone id="p02020029" />The maid
 replied: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, he has put on the clothes, in which he shews
 to advantage, having a handsome person, and seeming to be a worthy
 man, and well-bred.</q> 
<milestone id="p02020030" /><q direct="unspecified">Go, call him then,</q> said the lady, <q direct="unspecified">tell him
 to come hither to the fire, and we will sup; for I know that he has
 not supped.</q> 
<milestone id="p02020031" />Rinaldo, on entering the room and seeing the lady,
 took her to be of no small consequence. He therefore made her a
 low bow, and did his utmost to thank her worthily for the service
 she had rendered him. <milestone id="p02020032" />His words pleased her no less than his
 person, which accorded with what the maid had said: so she made
 him heartily welcome, installed him at his ease by her side before the
 fire, and questioned him of the adventure which had brought him
 thither. Rinaldo detailed all the circumstances, <milestone id="p02020033" />of which the lady
 had heard somewhat when Rinaldo's servant made his appearance at
 the castle. She therefore gave entire credence to what he said, and
 told him what she knew about his servant, and how he might easily
 find him on the morrow. <milestone id="p02020034" />She then bade set the table, which done,
 Rinaldo and she washed their hands and sate down together to sup.
 <milestone id="p02020035" />Tall he was and comely of form and feature, debonair and gracious
 of mien and manner, and in his lusty prime. The lady had eyed
 him again and again to her no small satisfaction, and, her wantonness
 being already kindled for the Marquis, who was to have come
 to lie with her, she had let Rinaldo take the vacant place in her
 mind. So when supper was done, and they were risen from the
 table, she conferred with her maid, whether, after the cruel trick
 played upon her by the Marquis, it were not well to take the good
 gift which Fortune had sent her. <milestone id="p02020036" />The maid knowing the bent of
 her mistress's desire, left no word unsaid that might encourage her
 to follow it. Wherefore the lady, turning towards Rinaldo, who
 was standing where she had left him by the fire, began thus: 
<milestone id="p02020037" /><q direct="unspecified">So!
 Rinaldo, why still so pensive? Will nothing console you for the
 loss of a horse and a few clothes? Take heart, put a blithe face on
 it, you are at home; nay more, let me tell you that, seeing you in
 <pb n="78" />those clothes which my late husband used to wear, and taking you
 for him, I have felt, not once or twice, but perhaps a hundred times
 this evening, a longing to throw my arms round you and kiss you;
 and, in faith, I had so done, but that I feared it might displease you.</q>
 <milestone id="p02020038" />Rinaldo, hearing these words, and marking the flame which shot
 from the lady's eyes, and being no laggard, came forward with open
 arms, and confronted her and said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, I am not unmindful
 that I must ever acknowledge that to you I owe my life, in regard
 of the peril whence you rescued me. If then there be any way in
 which I may pleasure you, churlish indeed were I not to devise it.
 So you may even embrace and kiss me to your heart's content, and
 I will embrace and kiss you with the best of good wills.</q> There
 needed no further parley. <milestone id="p02020039" />The lady, all aflame with amorous desire,
 forthwith threw herself into his arms, and straining him to her
 bosom with a thousand passionate embraces, gave and received a
 thousand kisses before they sought her chamber. There with all
 speed they went to bed, nor did day surprise them until again and
 again and in full measure they had satisfied their desire. <milestone id="p02020040" />With the
 first streaks of dawn they rose, for the lady was minded that none
 should surmise aught of the affair. So, having meanly habited
 Rinaldo, and replenished his purse, she enjoined him to keep the

 entered. <milestone id="p02020041" />When it was broad day the gates were opened, and
 Rinaldo, passing himself off as a traveller from distant parts, entered
 the castle, and found his servant. Having put on the spare suit
 which was in his valise, he was about to mount the servant's horse,
 when, as if by miracle, there were brought into the castle the three
 gentlemen of the road who had robbed him the evening before,
 having been taken a little while after for another offence. Upon
 their confession Rinaldo's horse was restored to him, as were also his
 clothes and money; so that he lost nothing except a pair of garters,
 of which the robbers knew not where they had bestowed them.
 <milestone id="p02020042" />Wherefore Rinaldo, giving thanks to God and St. Julian, mounted
 his horse, and returned home safe and sound, and on the morrow the
 three robbers kicked heels in the wind.</p></div2><pb n="79" /><div2 type="novella" who="pampinea" id="nov0203"><head>Novel III</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02030001" />Three young men squander their substance and are

	notwithstanding
	it has been the theme of some of the foregoing stories, I add
	to them another, which, I believe, should give you pleasure.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02030006" />There was formerly in our city a knight, by name Messer
 Tedaldo, of the Lamberti, according to some, or, as others say, of the
 <pb n="80" />Agolanti
 family, perhaps for no better reason than that the occupation
 of his sons was similar to that which always was and is the
      occupation of the Agolanti. <milestone id="p02030007" />However, without professing to
 determine which of the two houses he belonged to, I say, that he
 was in his day a very wealthy knight, and had three sons, the eldest
 being by name Lamberto, the second Tedaldo, and the third
 Agolante. Fine, spirited young men were they all, though the
 eldest was not yet eighteen years old when their father, Messer
 Tedaldo, died very rich, leaving to them as his lawful heirs the
 whole of his property both movable and immovable. <milestone id="p02030008" />Finding
 themselves thus possessed of great wealth, both in money and in
 lands and chattels, they fell to spending without stint or restraint,
 indulging their every desire, maintaining a great establishment, and
 a large and well-filled stable, besides dogs and hawks, keeping ever
 open house, scattering largesses, jousting, and, not content with these
 and the like pastimes proper to their condition, indulging every
 appetite natural to their youth. <milestone id="p02030009" />They had not long followed this
 course of life before the cash left them by their father was exhausted;
 and, their rents not sufficing to defray their expenditure, they began
 to sell and pledge their property, and disposing of it by degrees, one
 item to-day and another to-morrow, they hardly perceived that they
 were approaching the verge of ruin, until poverty opened the eyes
 which wealth had fast sealed. <milestone id="p02030010" />So one day Lamberto called his
 brothers to him, reminded them of the position of wealth and
 dignity which had been theirs and their father's before them, and
 shewed them the poverty to which their extravagance had reduced
 them, and adjured them most earnestly that, before their destitution
 was yet further manifest, they should all three sell what little
 remained to them and depart thence; which accordingly they did.
 <milestone id="p02030011" />Without leave-taking, or any ceremony, they quitted Florence; nor
 did they rest until they had arrived in England and established
 themselves in a small house in London, where, by living with extreme
 parsimony and lending at exorbitant usances, they prospered so well
 that in the course of a few years they amassed a fortune; <milestone id="p02030012" />and so,
 one by one, they returned to Florence, purchased not a few of their
 former estates besides many others, and married. The management
 of their affairs in England where they continued their business of
 usurers, they left to a young nephew, Alessandro by name, while,
 <pb n="81" />heedless
 alike of the teaching of experience and of marital and
 parental duty, they all three launched out at Florence into more
 extravagant expenditure than before, and contracted debts on all
 hands and to large amounts. <milestone id="p02030013" />This expenditure they were enabled
 for some years to support by the remittances made by Alessandro,
 who, to his great profit, had lent money to the barons on the
 security of their castles and rents.</p><p><milestone id="p02030014" />While the three brothers thus continued to spend freely, and,
 when short of money, to borrow it, never doubting of help from
 England, it so happened that, to the surprise of everybody, there
 broke out in England a war between the King and his son, by which
 the whole island was divided into two camps; whereby Alessandro
 lost all his mortgages of the baronial castles and every other source of
 income whatsoever. <milestone id="p02030015" />However, in the daily expectation that peace
 would be concluded between the King and his son, Alessandro,
 hoping that in that event all would be restored to him, principal and
 interest, tarried in the island; and the three brothers at Florence in
 no degree retrenched their extravagant expenditure, but went on
 borrowing from day to day. <milestone id="p02030016" />Several years thus passed; and, their
 hopes being frustrated, the three brothers not only lost credit, but,
 being pressed for payment by their creditors, were suddenly arrested,
 and, their property proving deficient, were kept in prison for the
 balance, while their wives and little children went into the country
 parts, or elsewhere, wretchedly equipped, and with no other prospect
 than to pass the rest of their days in destitution. <milestone id="p02030017" />Alessandro, meanwhile,
 seeing that the peace, which he had for several years awaited
 in England, did not come, and deeming that he would hazard his
 life to no purpose by tarrying longer in the country, made up his
 mind to return to Italy. He travelled at first altogether alone; but
 it so chanced that he left Bruges at the same time with an abbot,
 habited in white, attended by a numerous retinue, and preceded by
 a goodly baggage-train. Behind the abbot rode two greybeard
 knights, kinsmen of the King, in whom Alessandro recognised
 acquaintances, and, making himself known to them, was readily
 received into their company. <milestone id="p02030018" />As thus they journeyed together,
 Alessandro softly asked them who the monks were that rode in front
 with so great a train, and whither they were bound. 
<milestone id="p02030019" /><q direct="unspecified">The foremost
 rider,</q> replied one of the knights, <q direct="unspecified">is a young kinsman of ours, the
 <pb n="82" />newly-elected
 abbot of one of the greatest abbeys of England; and
 as he is not of legal age for such a dignity, we are going with him to
 Rome to obtain the Holy Father's dispensation and his confirmation
 in the office; but this is not a matter for common talk.</q> 
<milestone id="p02030020" />Now the
 new abbot, as lords are wont to do when they travel, was sometimes
 in front, sometimes in rear of his train; and thus it happened that,
 as he passed, he set eyes on Alessandro, who was still quite young,
 and very shapely and well-favoured, and as courteous, gracious and
 debonair as e'er another. The abbot was marvellously taken with
 him at first sight, having never seen aught that pleased him so much,
 called him to his side, addressed him graciously, and asked him who
 he was, whence he came, and whither he was bound. <milestone id="p02030021" />Alessandro
 frankly told all about himself, and having thus answered the abbot's
 questions, placed himself at his service as far as his small ability
 might extend. <milestone id="p02030022" />The abbot was struck by his easy flow of apt speech,
 and observing his bearing more closely, he made up his mind that,
 albeit his occupation was base, he was nevertheless of gentle blood,
 which added no little to his interest in him; and being moved to
 compassion by his misfortunes, he gave him friendly consolation,
 bidding him be of good hope, that if he lived a worthy life, God
 would yet set him in a place no less or even more exalted than that
 whence Fortune had cast him down, and prayed him to be of his
 company as far as Tuscany, as both were going the same way.
 <milestone id="p02030023" />Alessandro thanked him for his words of comfort, and professed
 himself ready to obey his every command.</p><p><milestone id="p02030024" />So fared on the abbot, his mind full of new ideas begotten by the
 sight of Alessandro, until some days later they came to a town which
 was none too well provided with inns; and, as the abbot must needs
 put up there, Alessandro, who was well acquainted with one of the
 innkeepers, arranged that the abbot should alight at his house, and
 procured him the least discomfortable quarters which it could afford.
 He thus became for the nonce the abbot's seneschal, and being very
 expert for such office, managed excellently, quartering the retinue in
 divers parts of the town. So the abbot supped, and, the night being
 far spent, all went to bed except Alessandro, who then asked the host
 where he might find quarters for the night. 
<milestone id="p02030025" /><q direct="unspecified">In good sooth, I
 know not,</q> replied the host; <q direct="unspecified">thou seest that every place is occupied,
 and that I and my household must lie on the benches. How<pb n="83" />ever,
 in the abbot's chamber there are some corn-sacks. I can shew
 thee the way thither, and lay a bit of a bed upon them, and there, an
 it like thee, thou mayst pass the night very well.</q> <q direct="unspecified">How sayst
 thou?</q> 
<milestone id="p02030026" />said Alessandro; <q direct="unspecified">in the abbot's chamber, which thou
 knowest is small, so that there was not room for any of the monks
 to sleep there? Had I understood this when the curtains were
 drawn, I would have quartered his monks on the corn-sacks, and
 slept myself where the monks sleep.</q> 
<milestone id="p02030027" /><q direct="unspecified">'Tis even so, however,</q>
 replied the host, <q direct="unspecified">and thou canst, if thou wilt, find excellent quarters
 there: the abbot sleeps, the curtains are close drawn; I will go
 in softly and lay a small bed there, on which thou canst sleep.</q>
 <milestone id="p02030028" />Alessandro, satisfied that it might be managed without disturbing the
 abbot, accepted the offer, and made his arrangements for passing the
 night as quietly as he could.</p><p>The abbot was not asleep; his mind being far too overwrought
 by certain newly-awakened desires. He had heard what had passed
 between Alessandro and the host, he had marked the place where
 Alessandro had lain down, and in the great gladness of his heart had
 begun thus to commune with himself: <q direct="unspecified">God has sent me the
 opportunity of gratifying my desire; if I let it pass, perchance it
 will be long before another such opportunity occurs.</q> 
<milestone id="p02030029" />So, being
 minded by no means to let it slip, when all was quiet in the inn, he
 softly called Alessandro, and bade him lie down by his side. Alessandro
 made many excuses, but ended by undressing and obeying;
 <milestone id="p02030030" />whereupon the abbot laid a hand on Alessandro's breast, and began to
 caress him just as amorous girls do their lovers; whereat Alessandro
 marvelled greatly, doubting the abbot was prompted to such caresses
 by a shameful love. <milestone id="p02030031" />Which the abbot speedily divined, or else surmised
 from some movement on Alessandro's part, and, laughing,
 threw off a chemise which she had upon her, and taking Alessandro's
 hand, laid it on her bosom, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Alessandro, dismiss thy foolish
 thought, feel here, and learn what I conceal.</q> 
<milestone id="p02030032" />Alessandro obeyed,
 laying a hand upon the abbot's bosom, where he encountered two
 little teats, round, firm and delicate, as they had been of ivory;
 whereby he at once knew that 'twas a woman, and without awaiting
 further encouragement forthwith embraced her, and would have
 kissed her, when she said: 
<milestone id="p02030033" /><q direct="unspecified">Before thou art more familiar with me
 hearken to what I have to say to thee. As thou mayst perceive, I
 <pb n="84" />am no man, but a woman. Virgin I left my home, and was going
 to the Pope to obtain his sanction for my marriage, when, as Fortune
 willed, whether for thy gain or my loss, no sooner had I seen thee
 the other day, than I burned for thee with such a flame of love as
 never yet had lady for any man. Wherefore I am minded to have
 thee for my husband rather than any other; so, if thou wilt not
 have me to wife, depart at once, and return to thine own place.</q>
 <milestone id="p02030034" />Albeit he knew not who she was, Alessandro by the retinue which
 attended her conjectured that she must be noble and wealthy, and he
 saw that she was very fair; so it was not long before he answered
 that, if such were her pleasure, it was very much to his liking.
 <milestone id="p02030035" />Whereupon she sate up, set a ring on his finger, and espoused him
 before a tiny picture of our Lord; after which they embraced, and
 to their no small mutual satisfaction solaced themselves for the rest
 of the night. <milestone id="p02030036" />At daybreak Alessandro rose, and by preconcert with
 the lady, left the chamber as he had entered it, so that none knew
 where he had passed the night: then, blithe at heart beyond measure,
 he rejoined the abbot and his train, and so, resuming their journey,
 they after many days arrived at Rome. <milestone id="p02030037" />They had not been there
 more than a few days, when the abbot, attended by the two knights
 and Alessandro, waited on the Pope, whom, after making the due
 obeisance, he thus addressed: <q direct="unspecified">Holy Father, as you must know
 better than any other, whoso intends to lead a true and honourable
 life ought, as far as may be, to shun all occasion of error; for which
 cause I, having a mind to live honourably, did, the better to accomplish
 my purpose, assume the habit in which you see me, and depart
 by stealth from the court of my father, the King of England, who
 was minded to marry me, young as you see me to be, to the aged
 King of Scotland; and, carrying with me not a little of his treasure,
 set my face hitherward that your Holiness might bestow me in
 marriage. <milestone id="p02030038" />Nor was it the age of the King of Scotland that moved
 me to flee so much as fear lest the frailty of my youth should, were I
 married to him, betray me to commit some breach of divine law, and
 sully the honour of my father's royal blood. <milestone id="p02030039" />And as in this frame of
 mind I journeyed, God, who knows best what is meet for every
 one, did, as I believe, of His mercy shew me him whom He is pleased
 to appoint me for my husband, even this young man</q> (pointing to
 Alessandro) <q direct="unspecified">whom you see by my side, who for nobility of nature
 <pb n="85" />and bearing is a match for any great lady, though the strain of his
 blood, perhaps, be not of royal purity. <milestone id="p02030040" />Him, therefore, have I
 chosen, him will I have, and no other, no matter what my father or
 any one else may think. And albeit the main purpose with which I
 started is fulfilled, yet I have thought good to continue my journey,
 that I may visit the holy and venerable places which abound in this
 city, and your Holiness, and that so in your presence, and by consequence
 in the presence of others, I may renew my marriage-vow with
 Alessandro, whereof God alone was witness. <milestone id="p02030041" />Wherefore I humbly
 pray you that God's will and mine may be also yours, and that you
 pronounce your benison thereon, that therewith, having the more
 firm assurance of the favour of Him, whose vicar you are, we may
 both live together, and, when the time comes, die to God's glory
 and yours.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02030042" />Alessandro was filled with wonder and secret delight, when he
 heard that his wife was the daughter of the King of England; but
 greater still was the wonder of the two knights, and such their
 wrath that, had they been anywhere else than in the Pope's presence,
 they would not have spared to affront Alessandro, and perhaps the
 lady too. <milestone id="p02030043" />The Pope, on his part, found matter enough for wonder
 as well in the lady's habit as in her choice; but, knowing that he
 could not refuse, he consented to grant her request.</p><p>He therefore began by smoothing the ruffled tempers of the
 knights, and having reconciled them with the lady and Alessandro,
 proceeded to put matters in train for the marriage. <milestone id="p02030044" />When the day
 appointed was come, he gave a great reception, at which were
 assembled all the cardinals and many other great lords; to whom he
 presented the lady royally robed, and looking so fair and so gracious
 that she won, as she deserved, the praise of all, and likewise Alessandro,
 splendidly arrayed, and bearing himself not a whit like the young
 usurer but rather as one of royal blood, for which cause he received
 due honour from the knights. There, before the Pope himself, the
 marriage-vows were solemnly renewed; and afterwards the marriage,
 which was accompanied by every circumstance that could add grace
 and splendour to the ceremony, received the sanction of his benediction.
 <milestone id="p02030045" />Alessandro and the lady on leaving Rome saw fit to visit
 Florence, whither fame had already wafted the news, so that they
 were received by the citizens with every token of honour. The
 <pb n="86" />lady set the three brothers at liberty, paying all their creditors, and
 reinstated them and their wives in their several properties. So, leaving
 gracious memories behind them, Alessandro and his lady, accompanied
 by Agolante, quitted Florence, and arriving at Paris were
 honourably received by the King. <milestone id="p02030046" />The two knights went before
 them to England, and by their influence induced the King to restore
 the lady to his favour, and receive her and his son-in-law with every
 circumstance of joy and honour. Alessandro he soon afterwards
 knighted with unwonted ceremony, and bestowed on him the earldom
 of Cornwall. <milestone id="p02030047" />And such was the Earl's consequence and influence
 at court that he restored peace between father and son, thereby
 conferring a great boon on the island and gaining the love and esteem
 of all the people. Agolante, whom he knighted, recovered all the
 outstanding debts in full, and returned to Florence immensely rich.
 <milestone id="p02030048" />The Earl passed the rest of his days with his lady in great renown.
 Indeed there are those who say, that with the help of his father-in-law
 he effected by his policy and valour the conquest of Scotland,
 and was crowned king of that country.</p></div2><pb n="87" /><div2 type="novella" who="lauretta" id="nov0204"><head>Novel IV</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02040001" />Landolfo Ruffolo is reduced to poverty, turns corsair, is

 Well I know that my story, being compared with its predecessor,

 between Reggio and Gaeta; and in particular the slope which overlooks
 the sea by Salerno, and which the dwellers there call the Slope
 of Amalfi, is studded with little towns, gardens and fountains, and
 peopled by men as wealthy and enterprising in mercantile affairs as
 are anywhere to be found; in one of which towns, to wit, Ravello,
 rich as its inhabitants are to-day, there was formerly a merchant,
 who surpassed them all in wealth, Landolfo Ruffolo by name, who
 yet, not content with his wealth, but desiring to double it, came
      nigh to lose it all and his own life to boot. <milestone id="p02040006" />Know, then, that this
 man, having made his calculations, as merchants are wont, bought a
 <pb n="88" />great ship, which, entirely at his own expense, he loaded with divers
 sorts of merchandise, and sailed to Cyprus. <milestone id="p02040007" />There he found several
 other ships, each laden with just such a cargo as his own, and was
 therefore fain to dispose of his goods at a very cheap rate, insomuch
 that he might almost as well have thrown them away, and was
 brought to the verge of ruin. <milestone id="p02040008" />Mortified beyond measure to find
 himself thus reduced in a short space of time from opulence to something
 like poverty, he was at his wits' end, and rather than go home
 poor, having left home rich, he was minded to retrieve his losses by
 piracy or die in the attempt. <milestone id="p02040009" />So he sold his great ship, and with the
 price and the proceeds of the sale of his merchandise bought a light
 bark such as corsairs use, and having excellently well equipped her
 with the armament and all things else meet for such service, took to
 scouring the seas as a rover, preying upon all folk alike, but more
 particularly upon the Turk.</p><p><milestone id="p02040010" />In this enterprise he was more favoured by Fortune than in
 his trading adventures. A year had scarce gone by before he had
 taken so many ships from the Turk that not only had he recovered
 the fortune which he had lost in trade, but was well on the way
 to doubling it. <milestone id="p02040011" />The bitter memory of his late losses taught him
 sobriety; he estimated his gains and found them ample; and lest
 he should have a second fall, he schooled himself to rest content
 with them, and made up his mind to return home without attempting
 to add to them. <milestone id="p02040012" />Shy of adventuring once more in trade, he
 refrained from investing them in any way, but shaped his course
 for home, carrying them with him in the very same bark in which
 he had gotten them. <milestone id="p02040013" />He had already entered the Archipelago when
 one evening a contrary wind sprang up from the south-east, bringing
 with it a very heavy sea, in which his bark could not well have lived.
 He therefore steered her into a bay under the lee of one of the
 islets, and there determined to await better weather. <milestone id="p02040014" />As he lay
 there two great carracks of Genoa, homeward-bound from Constantinople,
 found, not without difficulty, shelter from the tempest
 in the same bay. The masters of the carracks espied the bark, and
 found out to whom she belonged: the fame of Landolfo and his
 vast wealth had already reached them, and had excited their natural
 cupidity and rapacity. They therefore determined to capture the
 bark, which lay without means of escape. <milestone id="p02040015" />Part of their men, well
 <pb n="89" />armed with cross-bows and other weapons, they accordingly sent
 ashore, so posting them that no one could leave the bark without
 being exposed to the bolts; the rest took to their boats, and rowed
 up to the side of Landolfo's little craft, which in a little time, with
 little trouble and no loss or risk, they captured with all aboard
 her. They then cleared the bark of all she contained, allowing
 Landolfo, whom they set aboard one of the carracks, only a pitiful
 doublet, and sunk her. <milestone id="p02040016" />Next day the wind shifted, and the carracks
 set sail on a westerly course, which they kept prosperously enough
 throughout the day; but towards evening a tempest arose, and the
 sea became very boisterous, so that the two ships were parted one
 from the other. <milestone id="p02040017" />And such was the fury of the gale that the ship,
 aboard which was poor, hapless Landolfo, was driven with prodigious
 force upon a shoal off the island of Cephalonia, and broke up and
 went to pieces like so much glass dashed against a wall. Wherefore
 the unfortunate wretches that were aboard her, launched amid the
 floating merchandise and chests and planks with which the sea was
 strewn, did as men commonly do in such a case; and though the night
 was of the murkiest and the sea rose and fell in mountainous surges,
 such as could swim sought to catch hold of whatever chance brought
 in their way. <milestone id="p02040018" />Among whom hapless Landolfo, who only the day
 before had again and again prayed for death, rather than he should
 return home in such poverty, now, seeing death imminent, was
 afraid; and, like the rest, laid hold of the first plank that came to
 hand, in the hope that, if he could but avoid immediate drowning,
 God would in some way aid his escape. Gripping the beam with
 his legs as best he might, while wind and wave tossed him hither
 and thither, he contrived to keep himself afloat until broad day:
 <milestone id="p02040019" />when, looking around him, he discerned nothing but clouds and sea
 and a chest, which, borne by the wave, from time to time drew
 nigh him to his extreme terror, for he apprehended it might strike
 against the plank, and do him a mischief; and ever, as it came near
 him, he pushed it off with all the little force he had in his hand.
 <milestone id="p02040020" />But, as it happened, a sudden gust of wind swept down upon the
 sea, and struck the chest with such force that it was driven against
 the plank on which Landolfo was, and upset it, and Landolfo went
 under the waves. Swimming with an energy begotten rather of
 fear than of strength, he rose to the surface only to see the plank
 <pb n="90" />so far from him that, doubting he could not reach it, he made for
 the chest, which was close at hand; and resting his breast upon the
 lid, he did what he could to keep it straight with his arms. <milestone id="p02040021" />In this
 manner, tossed to and fro by the sea, without tasting food, for not
 a morsel had he with him, and drinking more than he cared for,
 knowing not where he was, and seeing nothing but the sea, he
 remained all that day, and the following night. <milestone id="p02040022" />The next day, as
 the will of God, or the force of the wind so ordered, more like a
 sponge than aught else, but still with both hands holding fast by
 the edges of the chest, as we see those do that clutch aught to save
 themselves from drowning, he was at length borne to the coast of
 the island of Corfu, where by chance a poor woman was just then
 scrubbing her kitchen-ware with sand and salt-water to make it
 shine. The woman caught sight of him as he drifted shorewards,
 but making out only a shapeless mass, was at first startled, and
 shrieked and drew back. <milestone id="p02040023" />Landolfo was scarce able to see, and
 uttered no sound, for his power of speech was gone. However,
 when the sea brought him close to the shore, she distinguished the
 shape of the chest, and gazing more intently, she first made out the
 arms strained over the chest, and then discerned the face and divined
 the truth. <milestone id="p02040024" />So, prompted by pity, she went out a little way into the
 sea, which was then calm, took him by the hair of the head, and
 drew him to land, chest and all. Then, not without difficulty she
 disengaged his hands from the chest, which she set on the head of
 a little girl, her daughter, that was with her, carried him home like
 a little child, and set him in a bath, where she chafed and laved him
 with warm water, until, the vital heat and some part of the strength
 which he had lost being restored, she saw fit to take him out and
 regale him with some good wine and comfits. Thus for some days
 she tended him as best she could, until he recovered his strength, and
 knew where he was. <milestone id="p02040025" />Then, in due time, the good woman, who
 had kept his chest safe, gave it back to him, and bade him try his
 fortune.</p><p><milestone id="p02040026" />Landolfo could not recall the chest, but took it when she brought
 it to him, thinking that, however slight its value, it must suffice for
 a few days' charges. He found it very light, and quite lost hope;
 but when the good woman was out of doors, he opened it to see
 what was inside, and found there a great number of precious stones,
 <pb n="91" />some set, others unset. Having some knowledge of such matters,
 he saw at a glance that the stones were of great value; wherefore,
 feeling that he was still not forsaken by God, he praised His name,
 and quite recovered heart. <milestone id="p02040027" />But, having in a brief space of time
 been twice shrewdly hit by the bolts of Fortune, he was apprehensive
 of a third blow, and deemed it meet to use much circumspection in
 conveying his treasure home; so he wrapped it up in rags as best
 he could, telling the good woman that he had no more use for the
 chest, but she might keep it if she wished, and give him a sack in
 exchange. <milestone id="p02040028" />This the good woman readily did; and he, thanking
 her as heartily as he could for the service she had rendered him,
 threw his sack over his shoulders, and, taking ship, crossed to
 Brindisi. Thence he made his way by the coast as far as Trani,
 where he found some of his townsfolk that were drapers, to whom
 he narrated all his adventures except that of the chest. They in
 charity gave him a suit of clothes, and lent him a horse and their
 escort as far as Ravello, whither, he said, he was minded to return.
 <milestone id="p02040029" />There, thanking God for bringing him safe home, he opened his sack,
 and examining its contents with more care than before, found the
 number and fashion of the stones to be such that the sale of them
 at a moderate price, or even less, would leave him twice as rich as
 when he left Ravello. <milestone id="p02040030" />So, having disposed of his stones, he sent a
 large sum of money to Corfu in recompense of the service done him
 by the good woman who had rescued him from the sea, and also to
 his friends at Trani who had furnished him with the clothes; the
 residue he retained, and, making no more ventures in trade, lived
 and died in honourable estate.</p></div2><pb n="92" /><div2 type="novella" who="fiammetta" id="nov0205"><head>Novel V</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02050001" />Andreuccio da Perugia comes to Naples to buy horses,
 meets with three serious adventures in one night,
 comes safe out of them all, and returns home with
 a ruby.</p></argument><div3 who="fiammetta" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p02050002" />Landolfo's find of stones, began Fiammetta,
	on whom the
	narration now fell, has brought to my mind a story in which there are
	scarce fewer perilous scapes than in Lauretta's story, but with this
	difference, that, instead of a course of perhaps several years, a single
	night, as you shall hear, sufficed for their occurrence.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02050003" />In Perugia, by what I once gathered, there lived a young man,
 Andreuccio di Pietro by name, a horse-dealer, who, having learnt
 that horses were to be had cheap at Naples, put five hundred florins
 of gold in his purse, and in company with some other merchants
 went thither, never having been away from home before. On his
 arrival at Naples, which was on a Sunday evening, about vespers,
 he learnt from his host that the fair would be held on the following
 morning. Thither accordingly he then repaired, and looked at
 many horses which pleased him much, and cheapening them more
 and more, and failing to strike a bargain with any one, he from
 time to time, being raw and unwary, drew out his purse of florins
 in view of all that came and went, to shew that he meant business.</p><p><milestone id="p02050004" />While he was thus chaffering, and after he had shewn his purse,
 there chanced to come by a Sicilian girl, fair as fair could be, but
 ready to pleasure any man for a small consideration. He did not see
 her, but she saw him and his purse, and forthwith said to herself:
 <q direct="unspecified">Who would be in better luck than I if all those florins were
	mine?</q> and so she passed on. <milestone id="p02050005" />With the girl was an old woman,
 <pb n="93" />also a Sicilian, who, when she saw Andreuccio, dropped behind the
 girl, and ran towards him, making as if she would tenderly embrace
 him. The girl observing this said nothing, but stopped and waited
 a little way off for the old woman to rejoin her. <milestone id="p02050006" />Andreuccio turned
 as the old woman came up, recognised her, and greeted her very
 cordially; but time and place not permitting much converse, she
 left him, promising to visit him at his inn; and he resumed his
 chaffering, but bought nothing that morning.</p><p><milestone id="p02050007" />Her old woman's intimate acquaintance with Andreuccio had no
 more escaped the girl's notice than the contents of Andreuccio's
 purse; and with the view of devising, if possible, some way to make
 the money, either in whole or in part, her own, she began cautiously
 to ask the old woman, who and whence he was, what he did there,
 and how she came to know him. <milestone id="p02050008" />The old woman gave her almost
 as much and as circumstantial information touching Andreuccio and his
 affairs as he might have done himself, for she had lived a great while with
 his father, first in Sicily, and afterwards at Perugia. She likewise told
 the girl the name of his inn, and the purpose with which he had
 come to Naples. <milestone id="p02050009" />Thus fully armed with the names and all else that
 it was needful for her to know touching Andreuccio's kith and kin,
 the girl founded thereon her hopes of gratifying her cupidity, and
 forthwith devised a cunning stratagem to effect her purpose. Home
 she went, and gave the old woman work enough to occupy her all
 day, that she might not be able to visit Andreuccio; then, summoning
 to her aid a little girl whom she had well trained for such services,
 she sent her about vespers to the inn where Andreuccio lodged.
 <milestone id="p02050010" />Arrived there, the little girl asked for Andreuccio of Andreuccio
 himself, who chanced to be just outside the gate. On his answering
 that he was the man, she took him aside, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Sir, a lady of
 this country, so please you, would fain speak with you.</q> 
      <milestone id="p02050011" />Whereto
 he listened with all his ears, and having a great conceit of his person,
 made up his mind that the lady was in love with him, as if there
 were ne'er another handsome fellow in Naples but himself; so forthwith
 he replied, that he would wait on the lady, and asked where
 and when it would be her pleasure to speak with him. 
<milestone id="p02050012" /><q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> replied
 the little girl, <q direct="unspecified">she expects you in her own house, if you be pleased
 to come.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050013" /><q direct="unspecified">Lead on then, I follow thee,</q> said Andreuccio promptly,
 vouchsafing never a word to any in the inn. 
<milestone id="p02050014" />So the little girl guided
 <pb n="94" />him to her mistress's house, which was situated in a quarter the
 character of which may be inferred from its name, Evil Hole.
 Of this, however, he neither knew nor suspected aught, but, supposing
 that the quarter was perfectly reputable and that he was going to see
 a sweet lady, strode carelessly behind the little girl into the house of
 her mistress, whom she summoned by calling out, <q direct="unspecified">Andreuccio is
 here;</q> and Andreuccio then saw her advance to the head of the
 stairs to await his ascent. <milestone id="p02050015" />She was tall, still in the freshness of her
 youth, very fair of face, and very richly and nobly clad. As Andreuccio
 approached, she descended three steps to meet him with open
 arms, and clasped him round the neck, but for a while stood silent as
 if from excess of tenderness; then, bursting into a flood of tears, she
 kissed his brow, and in slightly broken accents said: <q direct="unspecified">O Andreuccio,
 welcome, welcome, my Andreuccio.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050016" />Quite lost in wonder
 to be the recipient of such caresses, Andreuccio could only answer:
 <q direct="unspecified">Madam, well met.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050017" />Whereupon she took him by the hand, led
 him up into her saloon, and thence without another word into her
 chamber, which exhaled throughout the blended fragrance of roses,
 orange-blossoms and other perfumes. He observed a handsome curtained
 bed, dresses in plenty hanging, as is customary in that country,
 on pegs, and other appointments very fair and sumptuous; which
 sights, being strange to him, confirmed his belief that he was in the
 house of no other than a great lady. <milestone id="p02050018" />They sate down side by side
 on a chest at the foot of the bed, and thus she began to speak:
 <q direct="unspecified">Andreuccio, I cannot doubt that thou dost marvel both at the
 caresses which I bestow upon thee, and at my tears, seeing that thou
 knowest me not, and, maybe, hast never so much as heard my name;
 wait but a moment and thou shalt learn what perhaps will cause thee
 to marvel still more, to wit, that I am thy sister; and I tell thee,
 that, since of God's especial grace it is granted me to see one, albeit
 I would fain see all, of my brothers before I die, I shall not meet
 death, when the hour comes, without consolation; but thou, perchance,
 hast never heard aught of this; wherefore listen to what I
 shall say to thee. <milestone id="p02050019" />Pietro, my father and thine, as I suppose thou
 mayst have heard, dwelt a long while at Palermo, where his good
 heart and gracious bearing caused him to be (as he still is) much
 beloved by all that knew him; but by none was he loved so much as
 by a gentlewoman, afterwards my mother, then a widow, who, casting
 <pb n="95" />aside all respect for her father and brothers, ay, and her honour,
 grew so intimate with him that a child was born, which child am I,
 thy sister, whom thou seest before thee. <milestone id="p02050020" />Shortly after my birth it so
 befell that Pietro must needs leave Palermo and return to Perugia, and
 I, his little daughter, was left behind with my mother at Palermo; nor,
 so far as I have been able to learn, did he ever again bestow a thought
 upon either of us. Wherefore--to say nothing of the love which he
 should have borne me, his daughter by no servant or woman of low
 degree--I should, were he not my father, gravely censure the ingratitude
 which he shewed towards my mother, who, prompted by a most
 loyal love, committed her fortune and herself to his keeping, without so
 much as knowing who he was. <milestone id="p02050021" />But to what end? The wrongs of
 long-ago are much more easily censured than redressed; enough that so
 it was. <milestone id="p02050022" />He left me a little girl at Palermo, where, when I was grown
 to be almost as thou seest me, my mother, who was a rich lady, gave
 me in marriage to an honest gentleman of the Girgenti family, who
 for love of my mother and myself settled in Palermo, and there, being
 a staunch Guelf, entered into correspondence with our King
 Charles;<note>Charles II. of Naples, son of Charles of Anjou.</note>
 <milestone id="p02050023" />which being discovered by King Frederic<note>Frederic II. of Sicily,
 younger son of Peter III. of Arragon.</note> before the time was ripe
 for action, we had perforce to flee from Sicily just when I was expecting
 to become the greatest lady that ever was in the island. So,
 taking with us such few things as we could, few, I say, in comparison
 of the abundance which we possessed, we bade adieu to our estates
 and palaces, and found a refuge in this country, and such favour with
 King Charles that, in partial compensation for the losses which we
 had sustained on his account, he has granted us estates and houses and
 an ample pension, which he regularly pays to my husband and thy
 brother-in-law, as thou mayst yet see. In this manner I live here;
 but that I am blest with the sight of thee, I ascribe entirely to the
 mercy of God; and no thanks to thee, my sweet brother.</q> <milestone id="p02050024" />So saying
 she embraced him again, and melting anew into tears kissed his
 brow.</p><p><milestone id="p02050025" />This story, so congruous, so consistent in every detail, came trippingly
 and without the least hesitancy from her tongue. Andreuccio
 remembered that his father had indeed lived at Palermo; he knew by
 his own experience the ways of young folk, how prone they are to
 <pb n="96" />love; he saw her melt into tears, he felt her embraces and sisterly
 kisses; and he took all she said for gospel. So, when she had done,
 he answered: 
<milestone id="p02050026" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam, it should not surprise you that I marvel,
 seeing that, in sooth, my father, for whatever cause, said never a word
 of you and your mother, or, if he did so, it came not to my knowledge,
 so that I knew no more of you than if you had not been;
 wherefore, the lonelier I am here, and the less hope I had of such
 good luck, the better pleased I am to have found here my sister.
 <milestone id="p02050027" />And indeed, I know not any man, however exalted his station, who
 ought not to be well pleased to have such a sister; much more, then,
 I, who am but a petty merchant; but, I pray you, resolve me of one
 thing: how came you to know that I was here?</q> 
<milestone id="p02050028" />Then answered
 she: <q direct="unspecified">'Twas told me this morning by a poor woman who is much
 about the house, because, as she tells me, she was long in the service
 of our father both at Palermo and at Perugia; and, but that it seemed
 more fitting that thou shouldst come to see me at home than that I
 should visit thee at an inn, I had long ago sought thee out.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050029" />She
 then began to inquire particularly after all his kinsfolk by name, and
 Andreuccio, becoming ever more firmly persuaded of that which it
 was least for his good to believe, answered all her questions. 
<milestone id="p02050030" />Their
 conversation being thus prolonged and the heat great, she had Greek
 wine and sweetmeats brought in, and gave Andreuccio to drink;
 and when towards supper-time he made as if he would leave, she
 would in no wise suffer it; but, feigning to be very much vexed, she
 embraced him, saying: 
<milestone id="p02050031" /><q direct="unspecified">Alas! now 'tis plain how little thou carest
 for me: to think that thou art with thy sister, whom thou seest for
 the first time, and in her own house, where thou shouldst have
 alighted on thine arrival, and thou wouldst fain depart hence to go
 sup at an inn! Nay but, for certain, thou shalt sup with me; and
 albeit, to my great regret, my husband is not here, thou shalt see that
 I can do a lady's part in shewing thee honour.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050032" />Andreuccio, not
 knowing what else to say, replied: <q direct="unspecified">Sister, I care for you with all
 a brother's affection; but if I go not, supper will await me all the
 evening at the inn, and I shall justly be taxed with discourtesy.</q>
 <milestone id="p02050033" />Then said she: <q direct="unspecified">Blessed be God, there is even now in the house
 one by whom I can send word that they are not to expect thee at the
 inn, albeit thou wouldst far better discharge the debt of courtesy by
 sending word to thy friends, that they come here to sup; and then,
 <pb n="97" />if go thou must, you might all go in a body.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050034" />Andreuccio replied,
 that he would have none of his friends that evening, but since she
 would have him stay, he would even do her the pleasure. She then
 made a shew of sending word to the inn that they should not expect
 him at dinner. Much more talk followed; and then they sate down
 to a supper of many courses splendidly served, which she cunningly
 protracted until nightfall; nor, when they were risen from table, and
 Andreuccio was about to take his departure, would she by any means
 suffer it, saying, that Naples was no place to walk about in after
 dark, least of all for a stranger, and that, as she had sent word to the
 inn that they were not to expect him at supper, so she had done the
 like in regard of his bed. <milestone id="p02050035" />Believing what she said, and being (in his
 false confidence) overjoyed to be with her, he stayed. <milestone id="p02050036" />After supper
 there was matter enough for talk both various and prolonged; and,
 when the night was in a measure spent, she gave up her own chamber
 to Andreuccio, leaving him with a small boy to shew him aught that
 he might have need of, while she retired with her women to another
 chamber.</p><p><milestone id="p02050037" />It was a very hot night; so, no sooner was Andreuccio alone than
 he stripped himself to his doublet, and drew off his stockings and laid
 them on the bed's head; and nature demanding a discharge of the
 surplus weight which he carried within him, he asked the lad
 where this might be done, and was shewn a door in a corner of
 the room, and told to go in there. <milestone id="p02050038" />Andreuccio, nothing doubting,
 did so, but, by ill luck, set his foot on a plank which was detached
 from the joist at the further end, whereby down it went, and he
 with it. By God's grace he took no hurt by the fall, though it
 was from some height, beyond sousing himself from head to foot
 in the ordure which filled the whole place, which, <milestone id="p02050039" />that you may
 the better understand what has been said, and that which is to
 follow, I will describe to you. A narrow and blind alley, such as
 we commonly see between two houses, was spanned by planks
 supported by joists on either side, and on the planks was the stool;
 of which planks that which fell with Andreuccio was one. 
<milestone id="p02050040" />Now
 Andreuccio, finding himself down there in the alley, fell to calling on
 the lad, who, as soon as he heard him fall, had run off, and promptly
 let the lady know what had happened. She hied forthwith to her
 chamber, and after a hasty search found Andreuccio's clothes and the
 <pb n="98" />money
 in them, for he foolishly thought to secure himself against
 risk by carrying it always on his person, and thus being possessed of
 the prize for which she had played her ruse, passing herself off as the
 sister of a man of Perugia, whereas she was really of Palermo, she
 concerned herself no further with Andreuccio except to close with
 all speed the door by which he had gone out when he fell. 
<milestone id="p02050041" />As the
 lad did not answer, Andreuccio began to shout more loudly; but all
 to no purpose. Whereby his suspicions were aroused, and he began
 at last to perceive the trick that had been played upon him; so he
 climbed over a low wall that divided the alley from the street, and
 hied him to the door of the house, which he knew very well. There
 for a long while he stood shouting and battering the door till it shook
 on its hinges; but all again to no purpose. 
<milestone id="p02050042" />No doubt of his misadventure
 now lurking in his mind, he fell to bewailing himself,
 saying: <q direct="unspecified">Alas! in how brief a time have I lost five hundred florins
 and a sister!</q> <milestone id="p02050043" />with much more of the like sort. Then he recommenced
 battering the door and shouting, to such a tune that not a
 few of the neighbours were roused, and finding the nuisance intolerable,
 got up; and one of the lady's servant-girls presented herself at
 the window with a very sleepy air, and said angrily: <q direct="unspecified">Who knocks
 below there?</q> 
<milestone id="p02050044" /><q direct="unspecified">Oh!</q> said Andreuccio, <q direct="unspecified">dost not know me? I
 am Andreuccio, Madam Fiordaliso's brother.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050045" /><q direct="unspecified">Good man,</q> she
 rejoined, <q direct="unspecified">if thou hast had too much to drink, go, sleep it off, and
 come back to-morrow. I know not Andreuccio, nor aught of the
 fantastic stuff thou pratest; prithee begone and be so good as to let
 us sleep in peace.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050046" /><q direct="unspecified">How?</q> said Andreuccio, <q direct="unspecified">dost not understand
 what I say? For sure thou dost understand; but if Sicilian kinships
 are of such a sort that folk forget them so soon, at least return me
 my clothes, which I left within, and right glad shall I be to be off.</q>
 <milestone id="p02050047" />Half laughing she rejoined: <q direct="unspecified">Good man, methinks thou dost
 dream:</q> and so saying, she withdrew and closed the window.
 <milestone id="p02050048" />Andreuccio by this time needed no further evidence of his wrongs;
 his wrath knew no bounds, and mortification well-nigh converted
 it into frenzy; he was minded to exact by force what he had
 failed to obtain by entreaties; and so, arming himself with a
 large stone, he renewed his attack upon the door with fury, dealing
 much heavier blows than at first. <milestone id="p02050049" />Wherefore, not a few of the
 neighbours, whom he had already roused from their beds, set him
 <pb n="99" />down as an ill-conditioned rogue, and his story as a mere fiction
 intended to annoy the good woman,<note>I. e. the bawd.</note> and
 resenting the din which
 he now made, came to their windows, just as, when a stranger dog
 makes his appearance, all the dogs of the quarter will run to bark at
 him, and called out in chorus: 
<milestone id="p02050050" /><q direct="unspecified">'Tis a gross affront to come at this
 time of night to the house of the good woman with this silly story.
 Prithee, good man, let us sleep in peace; begone in God's name; and
 if thou hast a score to settle with her, come to-morrow, but a truce
 to thy pestering to-night.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02050051" />Emboldened, perhaps, by these words, a man who lurked within
 the house, the good woman's bully, whom Andreuccio had as yet
 neither seen nor heard, shewed himself at the window, and said in a
 gruff voice and savage, menacing tone: <q direct="unspecified">Who is below there?</q>
 <milestone id="p02050052" />Andreuccio looked up in the direction of the voice, and saw standing
 at the window, yawning and rubbing his eyes as if he had just been
 roused from his bed, or at any rate from deep sleep, a fellow with a
 black and matted beard, who, as far as Andreuccio's means of judging
 went, bade fair to prove a most redoubtable champion. It was not
 without fear, therefore, that he replied: <q direct="unspecified">I am a brother of the
 lady who is within.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050053" />The bully did not wait for him to finish his
 sentence, but, addressing him in a much sterner tone than before,
 called out: <q direct="unspecified">I know not why I come not down and give thee play
 with my cudgel, whilst thou givest me sign of life, ass, tedious driveller
 that thou must needs be, and drunken sot, thus to disturb our
 night's rest.</q> Which said, he withdrew, and closed the window.
 <milestone id="p02050054" />Some of the neighbours who best knew the bully's quality gave
 Andreuccio fair words. <q direct="unspecified">For God's sake,</q> said they, <q direct="unspecified">good man,
 take thyself off, stay not here to be murdered. 'Twere best for thee
 to go.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050055" />These counsels, which seemed to be dictated by charity,
 reinforced the fear which the voice and aspect of the bully had
 inspired in Andreuccio, who, thus despairing of recovering his money
 and in the deepest of dumps, set his face towards the quarter whence
 in the daytime he had blindly followed the little girl, and began to
 make his way back to the inn. <milestone id="p02050056" />But so noisome was the stench
 which he emitted that he resolved to turn aside and take a bath in the
 sea. So he bore leftward up a street called Ruga Catalana, and was
 <pb n="100" />on his way towards the steep of the city, when by chance he saw two
 men coming towards him, bearing a lantern, and fearing that they
 might be patrols or other men who might do him a mischief, he stole
 away and hid himself in a dismantled house to avoid them. 
<milestone id="p02050057" />The
 house, however, was presently entered by the two men, just as if they
 had been guided thither; and one of them having disburdened himself
 of some iron tools which he carried on his shoulder, they both
 began to examine them, passing meanwhile divers comments upon
 them. <milestone id="p02050058" />While they were thus occupied, <q direct="unspecified">What,</q> said one, <q direct="unspecified">means
 this? Such a stench as never before did I smell the like!</q> So
 saying, he raised the lantern a little; whereby they had a view of
 hapless Andreuccio, and asked in amazement: <q direct="unspecified">Who is there?</q>
 <milestone id="p02050059" />Whereupon Andreuccio was at first silent, but when they flashed
 the light close upon him, and asked him what he did there in such
 a filthy state, he told them all that had befallen him. Casting
 about to fix the place where it occurred, they said one to another:
 <q direct="unspecified">Of a surety 'twas in the house of Scarabone Buttafuoco.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050060" />Then
 said one, turning to Andreuccio: <q direct="unspecified">Good man, albeit thou hast
 lost thy money, thou hast cause enough to praise God that thou
 hadst the luck to fall; for hadst thou not fallen, be sure that, no
 sooner wert thou asleep, than thou hadst been knocked on the head,
 and lost not only thy money but thy life. But what boots it now
 to bewail thee? Thou mightest as soon pluck a star from the
 firmament as recover a single denier; nay, 'tis as much as thy life
 is worth if he do but hear that thou breathest a word of the affair.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02050061" />The two men then held a short consultation, at the close of
 which they said: <q direct="unspecified">Lo now; we are sorry for thee, and so we
 make thee a fair offer. If thou wilt join with us in a little matter
 which we have in hand, we doubt not but thy share of the gain
 will greatly exceed what thou hast lost.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050062" />Andreuccio, being now
 desperate, answered that he was ready to join them. 
<milestone id="p02050063" />Now Messer
 Filippo Minutolo, Archbishop of Naples, had that day been buried
 with a ruby on his finger, worth over five hundred florins of gold,
 besides other ornaments of extreme value. The two men were
 minded to despoil the Archbishop of his fine trappings, and imparted
 their design to Andreuccio, <milestone id="p02050064" />who, cupidity getting the better of
 caution, approved it; and so they all three set forth. But as they
 were on their way to the cathedral, Andreuccio gave out so rank an
 <pb n="101" />odour that one said to the other: <q direct="unspecified">Can we not contrive that he
 somehow wash himself a little, that he stink not so shrewdly?</q>
 <milestone id="p02050065" /><q direct="unspecified">Why yes,</q> said the other, <q direct="unspecified">we are now close to a well, which
 is never without the pulley and a large bucket; 'tis but a step
 thither, and we will wash him out of hand.</q> <milestone id="p02050066" />Arrived at the well,
 they found that the rope was still there, but the bucket had been
 removed; so they determined to attach him to the rope, and
 lower him into the well, there to wash himself, which done, he
 was to jerk the rope, and they would draw him up. Lowered
 accordingly he was; but just as, now washen, he jerked the rope, 
<milestone id="p02050067" />it
 so happened that a company of patrols, being thirsty because 'twas a
 hot night and some rogue had led them a pretty dance, came to the
 well to drink. The two men fled, unobserved, as soon as they caught
 sight of the newcomers, who, parched with thirst, <milestone id="p02050068" />laid aside their
 bucklers, arms and surcoats, and fell to hauling on the rope, supposing
 that it bore the bucket, full of water. <milestone id="p02050069" />When, therefore, they saw
 Andreuccio, as he neared the brink of the well, loose the rope and
 clutch the brink with his hands, they were stricken with a sudden
 terror, and without uttering a word let go the rope, and took to flight
 with all the speed they could make. Whereat Andreuccio marvelled
 mightily, and had he not kept a tight grip on the brink of the well,
 he would certainly have gone back to the bottom and hardly have
 escaped grievous hurt, or death. Still greater was his astonishment,
 when, fairly landed on terra firma, he found the patrols' arms lying
 there, which he knew had not been carried by his comrades. 
<milestone id="p02050070" />He
 felt a vague dread, he knew not why; he bewailed once more his
 evil fortune; and without venturing to touch the arms, he left the
 well and wandered he knew not whither. As he went, however, he
 fell in with his two comrades, now returning to draw him out of the
 well; who no sooner saw him than in utter amazement they
 demanded who had hauled him up. Andreuccio answered that he
 knew not, and then told them in detail how it had come about, and
 what he had found beside the well. <milestone id="p02050071" />They laughed as they apprehended
 the circumstances, and told him why they had fled, and who
 they were that had hauled him up. Then without further parley,
 for it was now midnight, they hied them to the cathedral. They had
 no difficulty in entering and finding the tomb, which was a magnificent
 structure of marble, and with their iron implements they raised
 <pb n="102" />the lid, albeit it was very heavy, to a height sufficient to allow a man
 to enter, and propped it up. <milestone id="p02050072" />This done, a dialogue ensued. <q direct="unspecified">Who
 shall go in?</q> said one. 
<milestone id="p02050073" /><q direct="unspecified">Not I,</q> said the other. 
<milestone id="p02050074" /><q direct="unspecified">Nor I,</q>
 rejoined his companion; <q direct="unspecified">let Andreuccio go in.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050075" /><q direct="unspecified">That will not I,</q> said Andreuccio. 
<milestone id="p02050076" />Whereupon both turned upon him and said:
 <q direct="unspecified">How? thou wilt not go in? By God, if thou goest not in, we
 will give thee that over the pate with one of these iron crowbars
 that thou shalt drop down dead.</q> 
<milestone id="p02050077" />Terror-stricken, into the tomb
 Andreuccio went, saying to himself as he did so: <q direct="unspecified">These men will
 have me go in, that they may play a trick upon me: when I have
 handed everything up to them, and am sweating myself to get out
 of the tomb, they will be off about their business, and I shall be left
 with nothing for my pains.</q> So he determined to make sure of his
 own part first; and bethinking him of the precious ring of which he
 had heard them speak, as soon as he had completed the descent, he
 drew the ring off the Archbishop's finger, and put it on his own: he
 then handed up one by one the crosier, mitre and gloves, and other of
 the Archbishop's trappings, stripping him to his shirt; which done, he
 told his comrades that there was nothing more. <milestone id="p02050078" />They insisted that
 the ring must be there, and bade him search everywhere. This he
 feigned to do, ejaculating from time to time that he found it not;
 and thus he kept them a little while in suspense. But they, who
 were in their way as cunning as he, kept on exhorting him to make
 a careful search, and, seizing their opportunity, withdrew the prop
 that supported the lid of the tomb, and took to their heels, leaving
 him there a close prisoner. You will readily conceive how Andreuccio
 behaved when he understood his situation. 
<milestone id="p02050079" />More than once he
 applied his head and shoulders to the lid and sought with might and
 main to heave it up; but all his efforts were fruitless; so that at
 last, overwhelmed with anguish he fell in a swoon on the corpse of
 the Archbishop, and whether of the twain were the more lifeless,
 Andreuccio or the Archbishop, 'twould have puzzled an observer to
 determine.</p><p><milestone id="p02050080" />
      When he came to himself he burst into a torrent of tears, seeing
      now nothing in store for him but either to perish there of hunger
      and fetid odours beside the corpse and among the worms, or, should
      the tomb be earlier opened, to be taken and hanged as a thief. 
<milestone id="p02050081" />These
      most lugubrious meditations were interrupted by a sound of persons
      <pb n="103" />walking and talking in the church. They were evidently a numerous
      company, and their purpose, as Andreuccio surmised, was the very
      same with which he and his comrades had come thither: whereby
      his terror was mightily increased. <milestone id="p02050082" />Presently the folk opened the
      tomb, and propped up the lid, and then fell to disputing as to who
      should go in. None was willing, and the contention was protracted;
      but at length one--'twas a priest--said: <q direct="unspecified">Of what are ye afeared?
	Think ye to be eaten by him? Nay, the dead eat not the living. I
	will go in myself.</q> 
      So saying he propped his breast upon the edge
      of the lid, threw his head back, and thrust his legs within, that he
      might go down feet foremost. <milestone id="p02050083" />On sight whereof Andreuccio started
      to his feet, and seizing hold of one of the priest's legs, made as if he
      would drag him down; which caused the priest to utter a prodigious
      yell, and bundle himself out of the tomb with no small celerity.
      The rest took to flight in a panic, as if a hundred thousand devils
      were at their heels. <milestone id="p02050084" />The tomb being thus left open, Andreuccio, the
      ring still on his finger, sprang out. The way by which he had
      entered the church served him for egress, and roaming at random, he
      arrived towards daybreak at the coast. Diverging thence he came
      by chance upon his inn, where he found that his host and his
      comrades had been anxious about him all night. <milestone id="p02050085" />When he told
      them all that had befallen him, they joined with the host in advising
      him to leave Naples at once. He accordingly did so, and returned
      to Perugia, having invested in a ring the money with which he had
      intended to buy horses.

      makes us acquainted, and as discourse of such matter serves to

      felicitous, but the antecedent bitterness so long drawn out that scarce
      can I believe that it was ever sweetened by ensuing happiness.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02060005" />Dearest ladies, you must know that after the death of the
      Emperor Frederic II. the crown of Sicily passed to Manfred; whose
      favour was enjoyed in the highest degree by a gentleman of Naples,
      Arrighetto Capece by name, who had to wife Madonna Beritola
      Caracciola, a fair and gracious lady, likewise a Neapolitan. <milestone id="p02060006" />Now
      <pb n="105" />when Manfred was conquered and slain by King Charles I. at
      Benevento, and the whole realm transferred its allegiance to the
      conqueror, Arrighetto, who was then governor of Sicily, no sooner
      received the tidings than he prepared for instant flight, knowing that
      little reliance was to be placed on the fleeting faith of the Sicilians,
      and not being minded to become a subject of his master's enemy.
      <milestone id="p02060007" />But the Sicilians having intelligence of his plans, he and many other
      friends and servants of King Manfred were surprised, taken prisoners
      and delivered over to King Charles, to whom the whole island was
      soon afterwards surrendered. <milestone id="p02060008" />In this signal reversal of the wonted
      course of things Madam Beritola, knowing not what was become
      of Arrighetto, and from the past ever auguring future evil, lest she
      should suffer foul dishonour, abandoned all that she possessed, and with
      a son of, perhaps, eight years, Giusfredi by name, being also pregnant,
      fled in a boat to Lipari, where she gave birth to another male child,
      whom she named Outcast. Then with her sons and a hired nurse
      she took ship for Naples, intending there to rejoin her family.
      <milestone id="p02060009" />Events, however, fell out otherwise than she expected; for by stress
      of weather the ship was carried out of her course to the desert
      island of Ponza,<note>The largest, now inhabited, of a group of islets in
	the
	Gulf of Gaeta.</note> where they put in to a little bay until such time
      as they might safely continue their voyage. <milestone id="p02060010" />Madam Beritola
      landed with the rest on the island, and, leaving them all, sought out
      a lonely and secluded spot, and there abandoned herself to melancholy
      brooding on the loss of her dear Arrighetto. While thus she spent
      her days in solitary preoccupation with her grief it chanced that a
      galley of corsairs swooped down upon the island, and, before either
      the mariners or any other folk were aware of their peril, made
      an easy capture of them all and sailed away; <milestone id="p02060011" />so that, when Madam
      Beritola, her wailing for that day ended, returned, as was her wont,
      to the shore to solace herself with the sight of her sons, she found
      none there. At first she was lost in wonder, then with a sudden
      suspicion of the truth she bent her eyes seaward, and there saw the
 galley still at no great distance, towing the ship in her wake. Thus
 apprehending beyond all manner of doubt that she had lost her sons
 as well as her husband, and that, alone, desolate and destitute, she
 might not hope that any of her lost ones would ever be restored to
 <pb n="106" />her, she fell down on the shore in a swoon with the names of her
 husband and sons upon her lips. <milestone id="p02060012" />None was there to administer cold
 water or aught else that might recall her truant powers; her animal
 spirits might even wander whithersoever they would at their sweet
 will: strength, however, did at last return to her poor exhausted
 frame, and therewith tears and lamentations, as, plaintively repeating
 her sons' names, she roamed in quest of them from cavern to cavern.
 <milestone id="p02060013" />Long time she sought them thus; but when she saw that her labour
 was in vain, and that night was closing in, hope, she knew not why,
 began to return, and with it some degree of anxiety on her own
 account. Wherefore she left the shore and returned to the cavern
 where she had been wont to indulge her plaintive mood. <milestone id="p02060014" />She
 passed the night in no small fear and indescribable anguish; the new
 day came, and, as she had not supped, she was fain after tierce to
 appease her hunger, as best she could, by a breakfast of herbs: this
 done, she wept and began to ruminate on her future way of life.
 <milestone id="p02060015" />While thus engaged, she observed a she-goat come by and go into
 an adjacent cavern, and after a while come forth again and go into
 the wood: thus roused from her reverie she got up, went into the
 cavern from which the she-goat had issued, and there saw two kids,
 which might have been born that very day, and seemed to her the
 sweetest and the most delicious things in the world: and, having,
 by reason of her recent delivery, milk still within her, she took them
 up tenderly, and set them to her breast. <milestone id="p02060016" />They, nothing loath,
 sucked at her teats as if she had been their own dam; and thenceforth
 made no distinction between her and the dam. Which caused
 the lady to feel that she had found company in the desert; and so,
 living on herbs and water, weeping as often as she bethought her
 of her husband and sons and her past life, she disposed herself to
 live and die there, and became no less familiar with the she-goat
 than with her young.</p><p><milestone id="p02060017" />The gentle lady thus leading the life of a wild creature, it
 chanced that after some months stress of weather brought a Pisan
 ship to the very same bay in which she had landed. The ship lay
 there for several days, <milestone id="p02060018" />having on board a gentleman, Currado de'
 Malespini by name (of the same family as the Marquis), who with
 his noble and most devout lady was returning home from a pilgrimage,
 having visited all the holy places in the realm of Apulia. 
<milestone id="p02060019" />To
 <pb n="107" />beguile the tedium of the sojourn Currado with his lady, some
 servants and his dogs, set forth one day upon a tour through the
 island. As they neared the place where Madam Beritola dwelt,
 Currado's dogs on view of the two kids, which, now of a fair size,
 were grazing, gave chase. The kids, pursued by the dogs, made
 straight for Madam Beritola's cavern. <milestone id="p02060020" />She, seeing what was toward,
 started to her feet, caught up a stick, and drove the dogs back.
 Currado and his lady coming up after the dogs, gazed on Madam
 Beritola, now tanned and lean and hairy, with wonder, which she
 more than reciprocated. <milestone id="p02060021" />At her request Currado called off the
 dogs; and then he and his lady besought her again and again to
 say who she was and what she did there. So she told them all
 about herself, her rank, her misfortunes, and the savage life which
 she was minded to lead. <milestone id="p02060022" />Currado, who had known Arrighetto
 Capece very well, was moved to tears by compassion, and exhausted
 all his eloquence to induce her to change her mind, offering to escort
 her home, or to take her to live with him in honourable estate as his
 sister until God should vouchsafe her kindlier fortune. <milestone id="p02060023" />The lady
 declining all his offers, Currado left her with his wife, whom he bade
 see that food was brought thither, and let Madam Beritola, who was
 all in rags, have one of her own dresses to wear, and do all that she
 could to persuade her to go with them. <milestone id="p02060024" />So the gentle lady stayed
 with Madam Beritola, and after condoling with her at large on her
 misfortunes had food and clothing brought to her, and with the
 greatest difficulty in the world prevailed upon her to eat and dress
 herself. At last, after much beseeching, she induced her to depart
 from her oft-declared intention never to go where she might meet
 any that knew her, and accompany them to Lunigiana, taking with
 her the two kids and the dam, which latter had in the meantime
 returned, and to the gentle lady's great surprise had greeted
 Madam Beritola with the utmost affection. <milestone id="p02060025" />So with the return
 of fair weather Madam Beritola, taking with her the dam and the
 two kids, embarked with Currado and his lady on their ship, being
 called by them--for her true name was not to be known of
 all--Cavriuola;<note>I. e. she-goat.</note> and the wind holding
 fair, they speedily reached the
 mouth of the Magra,<note>Between Liguria and Tuscany.</note> and landing
 hied
 them to Currado's castle;
 <pb n="108" />

<milestone id="p02060026" />where Madam Beritola abode with Currado's lady in the quality of
 her maid, serving her well and faithfully, wearing widow's weeds,
 and feeding and tending her kids with assiduous and loving care.</p><p><milestone id="p02060027" />The corsairs, who, not espying Madam Beritola, had left her at
 Ponza when they took the ship on which she had come thither,
 had made a course to Genoa, taking with them all the other folk.
 On their arrival the owners of the galley shared the booty, and so
 it happened that as part thereof Madam Beritola's nurse and her two
 boys fell to the lot of one Messer Guasparrino d'Oria, who sent all
 three to his house, being minded to keep them there as domestic
 slaves. <milestone id="p02060028" />The nurse, beside herself with grief at the loss of her
 mistress and the woful plight in which she found herself and her
 two charges, shed many a bitter tear. <milestone id="p02060029" />But, seeing that they were
 unavailing, and that she and the boys were slaves together, she,
 having, for all her low estate, her share of wit and good sense, made
 it her first care to comfort them; then, regardful of the condition
 to which they were reduced, she bethought her, that, if the lads were
 recognised, 'twould very likely be injurious to them. So, still hoping
 that some time or another Fortune would change her mood, and
 they be able, if living, to regain their lost estate, she resolved to let
 none know who they were, until she saw a fitting occasion; and
 accordingly, whenever she was questioned thereof by any, she gave
 them out as her own children. <milestone id="p02060030" />The name of the elder she changed
 from Giusfredi to Giannotto di Procida; the name of the younger
 she did not think it worth while to change. She spared no pains
 to make Giusfredi understand the reason why she had changed his
 name, and the risk which he might run if he were recognised.
 This she impressed upon him not once only but many times; and
 the boy, who was apt to learn, followed the instructions of the wise
 nurse with perfect exactitude.</p><p><milestone id="p02060031" />So the two boys, ill clad and worse shod, continued with the
 nurse in Messer Guasparrino's house for two years, patiently performing
 all kinds of menial offices. <milestone id="p02060032" />But Giannotto, being now
 sixteen years old, and of a spirit that consorted ill with servitude,
 brooked not the baseness of his lot, and dismissed himself from
 Messer Guasparrino's service by getting aboard a galley bound
 for Alexandria, and travelled far and wide, and fared never the
 better. In the course of his wanderings he learned that his father,
 <pb n="109" />whom he had supposed to be dead, was still living, but kept in prison
 under watch and ward by King Charles. <milestone id="p02060033" />He was grown a tall
 handsome young man, when, perhaps three or four years after he
 had given Messer Guasparrino the slip, weary of roaming and all
 but despairing of his fortune, he came to Lunigiana, and by chance
 took service with Currado Malespini, who found him handy, and
 was well-pleased with him. <milestone id="p02060034" />His mother, who was in attendance
 on Currado's lady, he seldom saw, and never recognised her, nor
 she him; so much had time changed both from their former aspect
 since they last met. <milestone id="p02060035" />While Giannotto was thus in the service of
 Currado, it fell out by the death of Niccol&#242; da Grignano that his
 widow, Spina, Currado's daughter, returned to her father's house.
 Very fair she was and loveable, her age not more than sixteen years,
 and so it was that she saw Giannotto with favour, and he her, and
 both fell ardently in love with one another. <milestone id="p02060036" />Their passion was
 early gratified; but several months elapsed before any detected its
 existence. Wherefore, growing overbold, they began to dispense with
 the precautions which such an affair demanded. <milestone id="p02060037" />So one day, as
 they walked with others through a wood, where the trees grew fair
 and close, the girl and Giannotto left the rest of the company some
 distance behind, and, thinking that they were well in advance, found
 a fair pleasaunce girt in with trees and carpeted with abundance of
 grass and flowers, and fell to solacing themselves after the manner
 of lovers. <milestone id="p02060038" />Long time they thus dallied, though such was their
 delight that all too brief it seemed to them, and so it befell that they
 were surprised first by the girl's mother and then by Currado.
 Pained beyond measure by what he had seen, Currado, without
 assigning any cause, had them both arrested by three of his servants
 and taken in chains to one of his castles; where in a frenzy of
 passionate wrath he left them, resolved to put them to an ignominious
 death. <milestone id="p02060039" />The girl's mother was also very angry, and deemed her
 daughter's fall deserving of the most rigorous chastisement, but,
 when by one of Currado's chance words she divined the doom which
 he destined for the guilty pair, she could not reconcile herself to
 it, and hasted to intercede with her angry husband, beseeching him
 to refrain the impetuous wrath which would hurry him in his
 old age to murder his daughter and imbrue his hands in the
 blood of his servant, and vent it in some other way, as by close
 <pb n="110" />confinement and duress, whereby the culprits should be brought to
 repent them of their fault in tears. <milestone id="p02060040" />Thus, and with much more
 to the like effect, the devout lady urged her suit, and at length
 prevailed upon her husband to abandon his murderous design.
 Wherefore, he commanded that the pair should be confined in
 separate prisons, and closely guarded, and kept short of food and
 in sore discomfort, until further order; which was accordingly done;
 <milestone id="p02060041" />and the life which the captives led, their endless tears, their fasts of
 inordinate duration, may be readily imagined.</p><p>Giannotto and Spina had languished in this sorry plight for full
 a year, entirely ignored by Currado, when in concert with Messer
 Gian di Procida, King Peter of Arragon raised a rebellion<note>The Sicilian
 Vespers, Easter, 1282.</note> in the island
 of Sicily, and wrested it from King Charles, whereat Currado, being a
 Ghibelline, was overjoyed. <milestone id="p02060042" />Hearing the tidings from one of his warders,
 Giannotto heaved a great sigh, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Alas, fourteen years have I
 been a wanderer upon the face of the earth, looking for no other than
 this very event; and now, that my hopes of happiness may be for ever
 frustrate, it has come to pass only to find me in prison, whence I
 may never think to issue alive.</q> 
<milestone id="p02060043" /><q direct="unspecified">How?</q> said the warder; <q direct="unspecified">what
 signify to thee these doings of these mighty monarchs? What part
 hadst thou in Sicily?</q> 
<milestone id="p02060044" />Giannotto answered: <q direct="unspecified">'Tis as if my heart
 were breaking when I bethink me of my father and what part he had
 in Sicily. I was but a little lad when I fled the island, but yet I
 remember him as its governor in the time of King Manfred.</q>
 <milestone id="p02060045" /><q direct="unspecified">And who then was thy father?</q> demanded the warder. 
<milestone id="p02060046" /><q direct="unspecified">His
 name,</q> rejoined Giannotto, <q direct="unspecified">I need no longer scruple to disclose,
 seeing that I find myself in the very strait which I hoped to avoid by
 concealing it. He was and still is, if he live, Arrighetto Capece;
 and my name is not Giannotto but Giusfredi; and I doubt not but,
 were I once free, and back in Sicily, I might yet hold a very honourable
 position in the island.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02060047" />The worthy man asked no more questions, but, as soon as he found
 opportunity, told what he had learned to Currado; who, albeit he
 made light of it in the warder's presence, repaired to Madam Beritola,
 and asked her in a pleasant manner, whether she had had by Arrighetto
 a son named Giusfredi. The lady answered, in tears, that, if
 <pb n="111" />the elder of her two sons were living, such would be his name, and
 his age twenty-two years. <milestone id="p02060048" />This inclined Currado to think that
 Giannotto and Giusfredi were indeed one and the same; and it
 occurred to him, that, if so it were, he might at once shew himself
 most merciful and blot out his daughter's shame and his own by
 giving her to him in marriage; wherefore he sent for Giannotto
 privily, and questioned him in detail touching his past life. And
 finding by indubitable evidence that he was indeed Giusfredi, son of
 Arrighetto Capece, he said to him: 
<milestone id="p02060049" /><q direct="unspecified">Giannotto, thou knowest the
 wrong which thou hast done me in the person of my daughter, what
 and how great it is, seeing that I used thee well and kindly, and thou
 shouldst therefore, like a good servant, have shewn thyself jealous
 of my honour, and zealous in my interest; and many there are who,
 hadst thou treated them as thou hast treated me, would have caused
 thee to die an ignominious death; which my clemency would not
 brook. <milestone id="p02060050" />But now, as it is even so as thou sayst, and thou art of
 gentle blood by both thy parents, I am minded to put an end to thy
 sufferings as soon as thou wilt, releasing thee from the captivity in
 which thou languishest, and setting thee in a happy place, and reinstating
 at once thy honour and my own. <milestone id="p02060051" />Thy intimacy with Spina--albeit
 shameful to both--was yet prompted by love. Spina, as
 thou knowest, is a widow, and her dower is ample and secure. What
 her breeding is, and her father's and her mother's, thou knowest:
 of thy present condition I say nought. Wherefore, when thou wilt,
 I am consenting, that, having been with dishonour thy friend, she
 become with honour thy wife, and that, so long as it seem good to
 thee, thou tarry here with her and me as my son.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02060052" />Captivity had wasted Giannotto's flesh, but had in no degree
 impaired the generosity of spirit which he derived from his ancestry,
 or the whole-hearted love which he bore his lady. <milestone id="p02060053" />So, albeit he
 ardently desired that which Currado offered, and knew that he was
 in Currado's power, yet, even as his magnanimity prompted, so,
 unswervingly, he made answer: <q direct="unspecified">Currado, neither ambition nor
 cupidity nor aught else did ever beguile me to any treacherous
 machination against either thy person or thy property. <milestone id="p02060054" />Thy daughter
 I loved, and love and shall ever love, because I deem her worthy of
 my love; and, if I dealt with her after a fashion which to the
 mechanic mind seems hardly honourable, I did but commit that fault
 <pb n="112" />which is ever congenial to youth, which can never be eradicated so
 long as youth continues, and which, if the aged would but remember
 that they were once young and would measure the delinquencies
 of others by their own and their own by those of others, would not
 be deemed so grave as thou and many others depict it; and what
 I did, I did as a friend, not as an enemy. <milestone id="p02060055" />That which thou offerest
 I have ever desired, and should long ago have sought, had I supposed
 that thou wouldst grant it, and 'twill be the more grateful to me in
 proportion to the depth of my despair. <milestone id="p02060056" />But if thy intent be not such
 as thy words import, feed me not with vain hopes, but send me back
 to prison there to suffer whatever thou mayst be pleased to inflict; nor
 doubt that even as I love Spina, so for love of her shall I ever love
 thee, though thou do thy worst, and still hold thee in reverent
 regard.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02060057" />Currado marvelled to hear him thus speak, and being assured of
 his magnanimity and the fervour of his love, held him the more dear;
 wherefore he rose, embraced and kissed him, and without further
 delay bade privily bring thither Spina, who left her prison wasted and
 wan and weak, and so changed that she seemed almost another
 woman than of yore, even as Giannotto was scarce his former self.
 Then and there in Currado's presence they plighted their troth
 according to our custom of espousals; <milestone id="p02060058" />and some days afterwards
 Currado, having in the meantime provided all things meet for their
 convenience and solace, yet so as that none should surmise what had
 happened, deemed it now time to gladden their mothers with the
 news. So he sent for his lady and Cavriuola, and thus, addressing first
 Cavriuola, he spoke: <q direct="unspecified">What would you say, madam, were I to
 restore you your elder son as the husband of one of my daughters?</q>
 <milestone id="p02060059" />Cavriuola answered: <q direct="unspecified">I should say, that, were it possible for you
 to strengthen the bond which attaches me to you, then assuredly you
 had so done, in that you restored to me that which I cherish more
 tenderly than myself, and in such a guise as in some measure to renew
 within me the hope which I had lost: more I could not say.</q> And
 so, weeping, she was silent. <milestone id="p02060060" />Then, turning to his lady, Currado said:
 <q direct="unspecified">And thou, madam, what wouldst thou think if I were to present
 thee with such a son-in-law?</q> 
<milestone id="p02060061" /><q direct="unspecified">A son-in-law,</q> she answered,
 <q direct="unspecified">that was not of gentle blood, but a mere churl, so he pleased you,
 would well content me.</q> 
<milestone id="p02060062" /><q direct="unspecified">So!</q> returned Currado; <q direct="unspecified">I hope within
 a few days to gladden the hearts of both of you.</q></p><pb n="113" /><p><milestone id="p02060063" />He waited only until the two young folk had recovered their
 wonted mien, and were clad in a manner befitting their rank. Then,
 addressing Giusfredi, he said: <q direct="unspecified">Would it not add to thy joy to see
 thy mother here?</q> 
<milestone id="p02060064" /><q direct="unspecified">I dare not hope,</q> returned Giusfredi, <q direct="unspecified">that she
 has survived calamities and sufferings such as hers; but were it so,
 great indeed would be my joy, and none the less that by her counsel
 I might be aided to the recovery (in great measure) of my lost heritage
 in Sicily.</q> 
<milestone id="p02060065" />Whereupon Currado caused both the ladies to come
 thither, and presented to them the bride. The gladness with which
 they both greeted her was a wonder to behold, and no less great was
 their wonder at the benign inspiration that had prompted Currado to
 unite her in wedlock with Giannotto, <milestone id="p02060066" />whom Currado's words caused
 Madam Beritola to survey with some attention. A hidden spring of
 memory was thus touched; she recognised in the man the lineaments
 of her boy, and awaiting no further evidence she ran with open arms
 and threw herself upon his neck. No word did she utter, for very
 excess of maternal tenderness and joy; but, every avenue of sense
 closed, she fell as if bereft of life within her son's embrace. 
<milestone id="p02060067" />Giannotto,
 who had often seen her in the castle and never recognised her,
 marvelled not a little, but nevertheless it at once flashed upon him
 that 'twas his mother, and blaming himself for his past inadvertence
 he took her in his arms and wept and tenderly kissed her. 
<milestone id="p02060068" />With gentle
 solicitude Currado's lady and Spina came to her aid, and restored her
 suspended animation with cold water and other remedies. She then
 with many tender and endearing words kissed him a thousand times
 or more, which tokens of her love he received with a look of reverential
 acknowledgment. <milestone id="p02060069" />Thrice, nay a fourth time were these glad
 and gracious greetings exchanged, and joyful indeed were they that
 witnessed them, and hearkened while mother and son compared their
 past adventures. Then Currado, who had already announced his new
 alliance to his friends, and received their felicitations, proceeded to
 give order for the celebration of the event with all becoming gaiety
 and splendour. As he did so, Giusfredi said to him: 
<milestone id="p02060070" /><q direct="unspecified">Currado, you
 have long given my mother honourable entertainment, and on me
 you have conferred many boons; wherefore, that you may fill up the
 measure of your kindness, 'tis now my prayer that you be pleased to
 gladden my mother and my marriage feast and me with the presence
 of my brother, now in servitude in the house of Messer Guasparrino
 <pb n="114" />d'Oria, who, as I have already told you, made prize of both him and
 me; and that then you send some one to Sicily, who shall make himself
 thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances and condition of
 the country, and find out how it has fared with my father Arrighetto,
 whether he be alive or dead, and if alive, in what circumstances, and
 being thus fully informed, return to us with the tidings.</q> 
<milestone id="p02060071" />Currado
 assented, and forthwith sent most trusty agents both to Genoa and to
 Sicily. So in due time an envoy arrived at Genoa, and made instant
 suit to Guasparrino on Currado's part for the surrender of Outcast and
 the nurse, setting forth in detail all that had passed between Currado
 and Giusfredi and his mother. <milestone id="p02060072" />Whereat Messer Guasparrino was
 mightily astonished, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Of a surety there is nought that, being
 able, I would not do to pleasure Currado; and true it is that I have
 had in my house for these fourteen years the boy whom thou dost now
 demand of me, and his mother, and gladly will I surrender them; but
 tell Currado from me to beware of excessive credulity, and to put no
 faith in the idle tales of Giannotto, or Giusfredi, as thou sayst he
 calls himself, who is by no means so guileless as he supposes.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02060073" />Then, having provided for the honourable entertainment of the
 worthy envoy, he sent privily for the nurse, and cautiously sounded
 her as to the affair. The nurse had heard of the revolt of Sicily, and
 had learned that Arrighetto was still alive. She therefore banished
 fear, and told Messer Guasparrino the whole story, and explained to
 him the reasons why she had acted as she had done. 
<milestone id="p02060074" />Finding that
 what she said accorded very well with what he had learned from
 Currado's envoy, he inclined to credit the story, and most astutely
 probing the matter in divers ways, and always finding fresh grounds
 for confidence, he reproached himself for the sorry manner in which
 he had treated the boy, and by way of amends gave him one of his
 own daughters, a beautiful girl of eleven years, to wife with a dowry
 suited to Arrighetto's rank, <milestone id="p02060075" />and celebrated their nuptials with great
 festivity. He then brought the boy and girl, Currado's envoy, and the
 nurse in a well-armed galliot to Lerici, being there met by Currado,
 who had a castle not far off, where great preparations had been made
 for their entertainment: and thither accordingly he went with his
 whole company. 
<milestone id="p02060076" />What cheer the mother had of her son, the brothers
 of one another, and all the three of the faithful nurse; what cheer
 Messer Guasparrino and his daughter had of all, and all of them, and
 <pb n="115" />what cheer all had of Currado and his lady and their sons and their
 friends, words may not describe; wherefore, my ladies, I leave it to
 your imagination. And that their joy might be full, God, who, when
 He gives, gives most abundantly, added the glad tidings that Arrighetto
 Capece was alive and prosperous. <milestone id="p02060077" />For, when in the best of spirits the
 ladies and gentlemen had sat them down to feast, and they were yet
 at the first course, the envoy from Sicily arrived, and among other
 matters reported, that, no sooner had the insurrection broken out in the
 island than the people hied them in hot haste to the prison where
 Arrighetto was kept in confinement by King Charles, and despatching
 the guards, brought him forth, and knowing him to be a capital
 enemy to King Charles made him their captain, and under his command
 fell upon and massacred the French. <milestone id="p02060078" />Whereby he had won
 the highest place in the favour of King Peter, who had granted him
 restitution of all his estates and honours, so that he was now both
 prosperous and mighty. The envoy added that Arrighetto had
 received him with every token of honour, had manifested the utmost
 delight on hearing of his lady and son, of whom no tidings had reached
 him since his arrest, and had sent, to bring them home, a brigantine
 with some gentlemen aboard, whose arrival might hourly be expected.</p><p><milestone id="p02060079" />The envoy, and the good news which he brought, were heartily
 welcome; and presently Currado, with some of his friends, encountered
 the gentlemen who came for Madam Beritola and Giusfredi, and
 saluting them cordially invited them to his feast, which was not yet
 half done. <milestone id="p02060080" />Joy unheard-of was depicted on the faces of the lady, of
 Giusfredi, and of all the rest as they greeted them; nor did they on
 their part take their places at the table before, as best they might,
 they had conveyed to Currado and his lady Arrighetto's greetings and
 grateful acknowledgments of the honour which they had conferred
 upon his lady and his son, and had placed Arrighetto, to the uttermost
 of his power, entirely at their service. <milestone id="p02060081" />Then, turning to Messer
 Guasparrino, of whose kindness Arrighetto surmised nothing, they
 said that they were very sure that, when he learned the boon which
 Outcast had received at his hands, he would pay him the like and an
 even greater tribute of gratitude. This speech ended, they feasted
 most joyously with the brides and bridegrooms. <milestone id="p02060082" />So passed the day,
 the first of many which Currado devoted to honouring his son-in-law
 and his other intimates, both kinsfolk and friends. The time of
 <pb n="116" />festivity ended, Madam Beritola and Giusfredi and the rest felt that
 they must leave: so, taking Spina with them, they parted, not
 without many tears, from Currado and his lady and Guasparrino, and
 went aboard the brigantine, <milestone id="p02060083" />which, wafted by a prosperous wind,
 soon brought them to Sicily. At Palermo they were met by
 Arrighetto, who received them all, ladies and sons alike, with such
 cheer as it were vain to attempt to describe. There it is believed
 that they all lived long and happily and in amity with God, being
 not unmindful of the blessings which He had conferred upon them.</p></div2><pb n="117" /><div2 type="novella" who="panfilo" id="nov0207"><head>Novel VII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02070001" />The Soldan of Babylon sends one of his daughters overseas,

 now that it was ended, the Queen bade Pamfilo follow suit; and he,
 than whom none was more obedient, thus began:</p></div3><div3 who="panfilo" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p02070003" />Hardly, gracious ladies, is it given to us to know that which makes
 for our good; insomuch that, as has been observable in a multitude
 of instances, many, deeming that the acquisition of great riches would
 ensure them an easy and tranquil existence, have not only besought
 them of God in prayer, but have sought them with such ardour that
 they have spared no pains and shrunk from no danger in the quest,
 and have attained their end only to lose, at the hands of some one
 covetous of their vast inheritance, a life with which before the days
 of their prosperity they were well content. <milestone id="p02070004" />Others, whose course,
 perilous with a thousand battles, stained with the blood of their
 brothers and their friends, has raised them from base to regal estate,
 have found in place of the felicity they expected an infinity of cares
 and fears, and have proved by experience that a chalice may be
 poisoned, though it be of gold, and set on the table of a king. 
<milestone id="p02070005" />Many
 <pb n="118" />have most ardently desired beauty and strength and other advantages
 of person, and have only been taught their error by the death or
 dolorous life which these very advantages entailed upon them.
 <milestone id="p02070006" />And so, not to instance each particular human desire, I say, in sum,
 that there is none of them that men may indulge in full confidence
 as exempt from the chances and changes of fortune; wherefore, if we
 would act rightly, we ought to school ourselves to take and be
 content with that which He gives us, who alone knows and can
 afford us that of which we have need. <milestone id="p02070007" />But, divers as are the
 aberrations of desire to which men are prone, so, gracious ladies,
 there is one to which you are especially liable, in that you are unduly
 solicitous of beauty, insomuch, that, not content with the charms
 which nature has allotted you, you endeavour to enhance them with
 wondrous ingenuity of art; wherefore I am minded to make you
 acquainted with the coil of misadventures in which her beauty
 involved a fair Saracen, who in the course of, perhaps, four years was
 wedded nine several times.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02070008" />There was of yore a Soldan of Babylon,<note>I. e. according to
 medieval usage, Egypt.</note> by name of Beminedab,
 who in his day had cause enough to be well content with his luck.
 <milestone id="p02070009" />Many children male and female had he, and among them a daughter,
 Alatiel by name, who by common consent of all that saw her was
 the most beautiful woman then to be found in the world. Now the
 Soldan, having been signally aided by the King of Algarve<note>I. e.
 Garbo, the coast of Africa opposite Andalusia and Granada.</note> in
 inflicting a great defeat upon a host of Arabs that had attacked him,
 had at his instance and by way of special favour given Alatiel to the
 King to wife; wherefore, with an honourable escort of gentlemen
 and ladies most nobly and richly equipped, he placed her aboard a
 well-armed, well-furnished ship, and, commending her to God, sped
 her on her journey. <milestone id="p02070010" />The mariners, as soon as the weather was
 favourable, hoisted sail, and for some days after their departure from
 Alexandria had a prosperous voyage; but when they had passed
 Sardinia, and were beginning to think that they were nearing their
 journey's end, they were caught one day between divers cross winds,
 each blowing with extreme fury, whereby the ship laboured so sorely
 that not only the lady but the seamen from time to time gave them<pb n="119" />selves
 up for lost. <milestone id="p02070011" />But still, most manfully and skilfully they
 struggled might and main with the tempest, which, ever waxing
 rather than waning, buffeted them for two days with immense unintermittent
 surges; and being not far from the island of Majorca, as
 the third night began to close in, wrapt in clouds and mist and thick
 darkness, so that they saw neither the sky nor aught else, nor by any
 nautical skill might conjecture where they were, they felt the ship's
 timbers part. <milestone id="p02070012" />Wherefore, seeing no way to save the ship, each thought
 only how best to save himself, and, a boat being thrown out, the
 masters first, and then the men, one by one, though the first-comers
 sought with knives in their hands to bar the passage of the rest, all,
 rather than remain in the leaky ship, crowded into it, and there
 found the death which they hoped to escape. <milestone id="p02070013" />For the boat, being in
 such stress of weather and with such a burden quite unmanageable,
 went under, and all aboard her perished; whereas the ship, leaky
 though she was, and all but full of water, yet, driven by the fury of
 the tempest, was hurled with prodigious velocity upon the shore of
 the island of Majorca, and struck it with such force as to embed
 herself in the sand, perhaps a stone's throw from terra firma, where
 she remained all night beaten and washed by the sea, but no more
 to be moved by the utmost violence of the gale. None had remained
 aboard her but the lady and her women, whom the malice of
 the elements and their fears had brought to the verge of death.
      <milestone id="p02070014" />When it was broad day and the storm was somewhat abated, the
 lady, half dead, raised her head, and in faltering accents began to call
 first one and then another of her servants. She called in vain, however;
 for those whom she called were too far off to hear. <milestone id="p02070015" />Great
 indeed was her wonder and fear to find herself thus without sight of
 human face or sound of other voice than her own; but, struggling
 to her feet as best she might, she looked about her, and saw the ladies
 that were of her escort, and the other women, all prostrate on the
 deck; so, after calling them one by one, she began at length to touch
 them, and finding few that shewed sign of life, for indeed, between
 grievous sea-sickness and fear, they had little life left, she grew more
 terrified than before. <milestone id="p02070016" />However, being in sore need of counsel, all
 alone as she was, and without knowledge or means of learning where
 she was, she at last induced such as had life in them to get upon their
 feet, with whom, as none knew where the men were gone, and the
 <pb n="120" />ship was now full of water and visibly breaking up, she abandoned
 herself to piteous lamentations.</p><p><milestone id="p02070017" />It was already none before they descried any one on the shore or
 elsewhere to whom they could make appeal for help; but shortly
 after none it so chanced that a gentleman, Pericone da Visalgo by
 name, being on his return from one of his estates, passed that way
 with some mounted servants. Catching sight of the ship, he apprehended
 the circumstances at a glance, and bade one of his servants
 try to get aboard her, and let him know the result. <milestone id="p02070018" />The servant
 with some difficulty succeeded in boarding the vessel, and found the
 gentle lady with her few companions ensconced under shelter of the
 prow, and shrinking timidly from observation. <milestone id="p02070019" />At the first sight of
 him they wept, and again and again implored him to have pity on
 them; but finding that he did not understand them, nor they him,
 they sought by gestures to make him apprehend their forlorn
 condition.</p><p><milestone id="p02070020" />With these tidings the servant, after making such survey of the
 ship as he could, returned to Pericone, who forthwith caused the
 ladies, and all articles of value which were in the ship and could be
 removed, to be brought off her, and took them with him to one of
 his castles. The ladies' powers were soon in a measure restored by
 food and rest, and by the honour which was paid to Alatiel, and
 Alatiel alone by all the rest, as well as by the richness of her dress,
 Pericone perceived that she must be some great lady. <milestone id="p02070021" />Nor, though
 she was still pale, and her person bore evident marks of the sea's
 rough usage, did he fail to note that it was cast in a mould of
 extraordinary
 beauty. Wherefore his mind was soon made up that, if she
 lacked a husband, he would take her to wife, and that, if he could
 not have her to wife, then he would make her his mistress. <milestone id="p02070022" />So
 this ardent lover, who was a man of powerful frame and haughty
 mien, devoted himself for several days to the service of the
 lady with excellent effect, for the lady completely recovered her
 strength and spirits, so that her beauty far exceeded Pericone's most
 sanguine conjectures. Great therefore beyond measure was his
 sorrow that he understood not her speech, nor she his, so that neither
 could know who the other was; but being inordinately enamoured of
 her beauty, he sought by such mute blandishments as he could devise
 to declare his love, and bring her of her own accord to gratify his
 <pb n="121" />desire. All in vain, however; she repulsed his advances point blank;
 whereby his passion only grew the stronger. <milestone id="p02070023" />So some days passed;
 and the lady perceiving Pericone's constancy, and bethinking her that
 sooner or later she must yield either to force or to love, and gratify his
 passion, and judging by what she observed of the customs of the people
 that she was amongst Christians, and in a part where, were she able
 to speak their language, she would gain little by making herself
 known, determined with a lofty courage to stand firm and immovable
 in this extremity of her misfortunes. <milestone id="p02070024" />Wherefore she bade the
 three women, who were all that were left to her, on no account to let
 any know who they were, unless they were so circumstanced that
 they might safely count on assistance in effecting their escape: she
 also exhorted them most earnestly to preserve their chastity, averring
 that she was firmly resolved that none but her husband should enjoy
 her. The women heartily assented, and promised that her injunctions
 should be obeyed to the utmost of their power.</p><p><milestone id="p02070025" />Day by day Pericone's passion waxed more ardent, being fomented
 by the proximity and contrariety of its object. Wherefore seeing
 that blandishment availed nothing, he was minded to have recourse to
 wiles and stratagems, and in the last resort to force. 
<milestone id="p02070026" />The lady,
 debarred by her law from the use of wine, found it, perhaps, on that
 account all the more palatable; which Pericone observing determined
 to enlist Bacchus in the service of Venus. So, ignoring her
 coyness, he provided one evening a supper, which was ordered with
 all possible pomp and beauty, and graced by the presence of the lady.
 No lack was there of incentives to hilarity; and Pericone directed
 the servant who waited on Alatiel to ply her with divers sorts of
 blended wines; <milestone id="p02070027" />which command the man faithfully executed. She,
 suspecting nothing, and seduced by the delicious flavour of the
 liquor, drank somewhat more freely than was seemly, and forgetting
 her past woes, became frolicsome, and incited by some women who
 trod some measures in the Majorcan style, she shewed the company
 how they footed it in Alexandria. <milestone id="p02070028" />This novel demeanour was by no
 means lost on Pericone, who saw in it a good omen of his speedy
 success; so, with profuse relays of food and wine he prolonged the
 supper far into the night.</p><p><milestone id="p02070029" />When the guests were at length gone, he attended the lady alone
 to her chamber, where, the heat of the wine overpowering the cold
 <pb n="122" />counsels of modesty, she made no more account of Pericone's presence
 than if he had been one of her women, and forthwith undressed and
 went to bed. <milestone id="p02070030" />Pericone was not slow to follow her, and as soon as
 the light was out lay down by her side, and taking her in his arms,
 without the least demur on her part, began to solace himself with her
 after the manner of lovers; which experience--she knew not till then
 with what horn men butt--caused her to repent that she had not
 yielded to his blandishments; nor did she thereafter wait to be
 invited to such nights of delight, but many a time declared her readiness,
 not by words, for she had none to convey her meaning, but by
 gestures.</p><p><milestone id="p02070031" />But this great felicity which she now shared with Pericone was
 not to last: for not content with making her, instead of the consort
 of a king, the mistress of a castellan, Fortune had now in store for her
 a harsher experience, though of an amorous character. <milestone id="p02070032" />Pericone had
 a brother, twenty-five years of age, fair and fresh as a rose, his name
 Marato. On sight of Alatiel Marato had been mightily taken with
 her; he inferred from her bearing that he stood high in her good
 graces; he believed that nothing stood between him and the gratification
 of his passion but the jealous vigilance with which Pericone
 guarded her. So musing, he hit upon a ruthless expedient, which
 had effect in action as hasty as heinous.</p><p><milestone id="p02070033" />It so chanced that there then lay in the port of the city a ship,
 commanded by two Genoese, bound with a cargo of merchandise for
 Klarenza in the Morea: her sails were already hoist; and she tarried
 only for a favourable breeze. Marato approached the masters and
 arranged with them to take himself and the lady aboard on the
 following night. <milestone id="p02070034" />This done he concerted further action with some
 of his most trusty friends, who readily lent him their aid to carry his
 design into execution. So on the following evening towards nightfall,
 the conspirators stole unobserved into Pericone's house, which
 was entirely unguarded, and there hid themselves, as pre-arranged.
 <milestone id="p02070035" />Then, as the night wore on, Marato shewed them where Pericone
 and the lady slept, and they entered the room, and slew Pericone.
 The lady thus rudely roused wept; but silencing her by menaces of
 death they carried her off with the best part of Pericone's treasure,
 and hied them unobserved to the coast, where Marato parted from his
 companions, and forthwith took the lady aboard the ship. <milestone id="p02070036" />The wind
 <pb n="123" />was now fair and fresh, the mariners spread the canvas, and the vessel
 sped on her course.</p><p><milestone id="p02070037" />This new misadventure, following so hard upon the former, caused
 the lady no small chagrin; but Marato, with the aid of the good St.
 Crescent-in-hand that God has given us, found means to afford her
 such consolation that she was already grown so familiar with him as
 entirely to forget Pericone, when Fortune, not content with her
 former caprices, added a new dispensation of woe; <milestone id="p02070038" />for what with
 the beauty of her person, which, as we have often said, was extraordinary,
 and the exquisite charm of her manners, the two young
 men, who commanded the ship, fell so desperately in love with her
 that they thought of nothing but how they might best serve and
 please her, so only that Marato should not discover the reason of their
 assiduous attentions. <milestone id="p02070039" />And neither being ignorant of the other's love,
 they held secret counsel together, and resolved to make conquest of
 the lady on joint account: as if love admitted of being held in partnership
 like merchandise or money. <milestone id="p02070040" />Which design being thwarted
 by the jealousy with which Alatiel was guarded by Marato, they
 chose a day and hour, when the ship was speeding amain under canvas,
 and Marato was on the poop looking out over the sea and quite off
 his guard; and going stealthily up behind him, they suddenly laid
 hands on him, and threw him into the sea, and were already more
 than a mile on their course before any perceived that Marato was
 overboard. Which when the lady learned, and knew that he was
 irretrievably lost, she relapsed into her former plaintive mood. 
<milestone id="p02070041" />But
 the twain were forthwith by her side with soft speeches and profuse
 promises, which, however ill she understood them, were not altogether
 inapt to allay a grief which had in it more of concern for her own
 hapless self than of sorrow for her lost lover. So, in course of time,
 the lady beginning visibly to recover heart, they began privily to
 debate which of them should first take her to bed with him; <milestone id="p02070042" />and
 neither being willing to give way to the other, and no compromise
 being discoverable, high words passed between them, and the dispute
 grew so hot, that they both waxed very wroth, drew their knives, and
 rushed madly at one another, and before they could be parted by their
 men, several stabs had been given and received on either side, whereby
 the one fell dead on the spot, and the other was severely wounded in
 divers parts of the body. <milestone id="p02070043" />The lady was much disconcerted to find
 <pb n="124" />herself thus alone with none to afford her either succour or counsel,
 and was mightily afraid lest the wrath of the kinsfolk and friends of
 the twain should vent itself upon her. From this mortal peril she
 was, however, delivered by the intercessions of the wounded man and
 their speedy arrival at Klarenza.</p><p><milestone id="p02070044" />As there she tarried at the same inn with her wounded lover, the
 fame of her great beauty was speedily bruited abroad, and reached the
 ears of the Prince of the Morea, who was then staying there. The
 Prince was curious to see her, and having so done, pronounced her even
 more beautiful than rumour had reported her; nay, he fell in love
 with her in such a degree that he could think of nought else; and
 having heard in what guise she had come thither, he deemed that he
 might have her. <milestone id="p02070045" />While he was casting about how to compass his
 end, the kinsfolk of the wounded man, being apprised of the fact,
 forthwith sent her to him to the boundless delight, as well of the lady,
 who saw therein her deliverance from a great peril, as of the Prince.
 <milestone id="p02070046" />The royal bearing, which enhanced the lady's charms, did not escape
 the Prince, who, being unable to discover her true rank, set her down
 as at any rate of noble lineage; wherefore he loved her as much again
 as before, and shewed her no small honour, treating her not as his
 mistress but as his wife. <milestone id="p02070047" />So the lady, contrasting her present happy
 estate with her past woes, was comforted; and, as her gaiety revived,
 her beauty waxed in such a degree that all the Morea talked of it and
 of little else: <milestone id="p02070048" />insomuch that the Prince's friend and kinsman, the
 young, handsome and gallant Duke of Athens, was smitten with a
 desire to see her, and taking occasion to pay the Prince a visit, as he
 was now and again wont to do, came to Klarenza with a goodly
 company of honourable gentlemen. The Prince received him with
 all distinction and made him heartily welcome, but did not at first
 shew him the lady. By and by, however, their conversation began
 to turn upon her and her charms, and the Duke asked if she were
 really so marvellous a creature as folk said. <milestone id="p02070049" />The Prince replied:
 <q direct="unspecified">Nay, but even more so; and thereof thou shalt have better assurance
 than my words, to wit, the witness of thine own eyes.</q> 
<milestone id="p02070050" />So, without
 delay, for the Duke was now all impatience, they waited on the lady,
 who was prepared for their visit, and received them very courteously
 and graciously. They seated her between them, and being debarred
 from the pleasure of conversing with her, for of their speech she
 <pb n="125" />understood little or nothing, they both, and especially the Duke, who
 was scarce able to believe that she was of mortal mould, gazed upon
 her in mute admiration; whereby the Duke, cheating himself with
 the idea that he was but gratifying his curiosity, drank with his eyes,
 unawares, deep draughts of the poisoned chalice of love, and, to his
 own lamentable hurt, fell a prey to a most ardent passion. 
<milestone id="p02070051" />His first
 thought, when they had left her, and he had time for reflection, was
 that the Prince was the luckiest man in the world to have a creature so
 fair to solace him; and swayed by his passion, his mind soon inclined
 to divers other and less honourable meditations, whereof the issue was
 that, come what might, he would despoil the Prince of his felicity, and,
 if possible, make it his own. 
<milestone id="p02070052" />This resolution was no sooner taken than,
 being of a hasty temperament, he cast to the winds all considerations
 of honour and justice, and studied only how to compass his end by
 craft. So, one day, as the first step towards the accomplishment of his
 evil purpose, he arranged with the Prince's most trusted chamberlain,
 one Ciuriaci, that his horses and all other his personal effects should,
 with the utmost secrecy, be got ready against a possible sudden departure:
 and then at nightfall, attended by a single comrade (both
 carrying arms), he was privily admitted by Ciuriaci into the Prince's
 chamber. It was a hot night, and the Prince had risen without
 disturbing the lady, and was standing bare to the skin at an open
 window fronting the sea, to enjoy a light breeze that blew thence.
 <milestone id="p02070053" />So, by preconcert with his comrade, the Duke stole up to the window,
 and in a trice ran the Prince through the body, and caught him up,
 and threw him out of the window. <milestone id="p02070054" />The palace was close by the
 sea, but at a considerable altitude above it, and the window, through
 which the Prince's body was thrown, looked over some houses, which,
 being sapped by the sea, had become ruinous, and were rarely or
 never visited by a soul; whereby, as the Duke had foreseen, the fall
 of the Prince's body passed, as indeed it could not but pass, unobserved.
 <milestone id="p02070055" />Thereupon the Duke's accomplice whipped out a halter,
 which he had brought with him for the purpose, and, making as if he
 were but in play, threw it round Ciuriaci's neck, drew it so tight that
 he could not utter a sound, and then, with the Duke's aid, strangled
 him, and sent him after his master. <milestone id="p02070056" />All this was accomplished, as the
 Duke knew full well, without awakening any in the palace, not even
 the lady, whom he now approached with a light, and holding it
 <pb n="126" />over the bed gently uncovered her person, as she lay fast asleep, and
 surveyed her from head to foot to his no small satisfaction; for fair
 as she had seemed to him dressed, he found her unadorned charms
 incomparably greater. <milestone id="p02070057" />As he gazed, his passion waxed beyond
 measure, and, reckless of his recent crime, and of the blood which
 still stained his hands, he got forthwith into the bed; and she, being
 too sound asleep to distinguish between him and the Prince, suffered
 him to lie with her.</p><p><milestone id="p02070058" />But, boundless as was his delight, it brooked no long continuance;
 so, rising, he called to him some of his comrades, by whom he had
 the lady secured in such manner that she could utter no sound, and
 borne out of the palace by the same secret door by which he had
 gained entrance; he then set her on horseback and in dead silence
 put his troop in motion, taking the road to Athens. <milestone id="p02070059" />He did not,
 however, venture to take the lady to Athens, where she would have
 encountered his Duchess--for he was married--but lodged her in a
 very beautiful villa which he had hard by the city overlooking the
 sea, where, most forlorn of ladies, she lived secluded, but with no lack
 of meet and respectful service.</p><p><milestone id="p02070060" />On the following morning the Prince's courtiers awaited his
      rising until none, but perceiving no sign of it, opened the doors,
      which had not been secured, and entered his bedroom. Finding it
      vacant, they supposed that the Prince was gone off privily somewhere
      to have a few days of unbroken delight with his fair lady; and so
      they gave themselves no further trouble. <milestone id="p02070061" />But the next day it so
      chanced that an idiot, roaming about the ruins where lay the corpses
      of the Prince and Ciuriaci, drew the latter out by the halter and
      went off dragging it after him. The corpse was soon recognised by
      not a few, who, at first struck dumb with amazement, soon recovered
      sense enough to cajole the idiot into retracing his steps and shewing
      them the spot where he had found it; and having thus, to the
      immeasurable grief of all the citizens, discovered the Prince's body,
      they buried it with all honour. Needless to say that no pains were
      spared to trace the perpetrators of so heinous a crime, and that the
      absence and evidently furtive departure of the Duke of Athens
      caused him to be suspected both of the murder and of the abduction
      of the lady. <milestone id="p02070062" />So the citizens were instant with one accord that
      the Prince's brother, whom they chose as his successor, should exact
      <pb n="127" />the debt of vengeance; and he, having satisfied himself by further
      investigation that their suspicion was well founded, summoned to his
      aid his kinsfolk, friends and divers vassals, and speedily gathered a
      large, powerful and well-equipped army, with intent to make war
      upon the Duke of Athens. <milestone id="p02070063" />The Duke, being informed of his
      movements, made ready likewise to defend himself with all his
      power; nor had he any lack of allies, among whom the Emperor of
      Constantinople sent his son, Constantine, and his nephew, Manuel,
      with a great and goodly force. The two young men were honourably
      received by the Duke, and still more so by the Duchess, who
      was Constantine's sister.</p><p><milestone id="p02070064" />Day by day war grew more imminent; and at last the Duchess
      took occasion to call Constantine and Manuel into her private
      chamber, and with many tears told them the whole story at large,
      explaining the casus belli, dilating on the indignity which she
      suffered
      at the hands of the Duke, if, as was believed, he really kept a mistress
      in secret, and beseeching them in most piteous accents to do the best
      they could to devise some expedient whereby the Duke's honour
      might be cleared, and her own peace of mind assured. <milestone id="p02070065" />The young
      men knew exactly how matters stood; and so, without wearying the
      Duchess with many questions, they did their best to console her, and
      succeeded in raising her hopes. Before taking their leave they
      learned from her where the lady was, <milestone id="p02070066" />whose marvellous beauty they
      had heard lauded so often; and being eager to see her, they besought
      the Duke to afford them an opportunity. Forgetful of what a like
      complaisance had cost the Prince, he consented, and next morning
      brought them to the villa where the lady lived, and with her and a
      few of his boon companions regaled them with a lordly breakfast,
      which was served in a most lovely garden. <milestone id="p02070067" />Constantine had no
      sooner seated himself and surveyed the lady, than he was lost in
      admiration, inly affirming that he had never seen so beautiful a
      creature, and that for such a prize the Duke, or any other man,
      might well be pardoned treachery or any other crime: he scanned
      her again and again, and ever with more and more admiration; whereby
      it fared with him even as it had fared with the Duke. <milestone id="p02070068" />He went
      away hotly in love with her, and dismissing all thought of the war,
      cast about for some method by which, without betraying his passion to
      any, he might devise some means of wresting the lady from the Duke.</p><pb n="128" /><p><milestone id="p02070069" />As he thus burned and brooded, the Prince drew dangerously
      near the Duke's dominions; wherefore order was given for an
      advance, and the Duke, with Constantine and the rest, marshalled
      his forces and led them forth from Athens to bar the Prince's passage
      of the frontier at certain points. <milestone id="p02070070" />Some days thus passed, during
      which Constantine, whose mind and soul were entirely absorbed by
      his passion for the lady, bethought him, that, as the Duke was no
      longer in her neighbourhood, he might readily compass his end. He
      therefore feigned to be seriously unwell, and, having by this pretext
      obtained the Duke's leave, he ceded his command to Manuel, and
      returned to his sister at Athens. He had not been there many days
      before the Duchess recurred to the dishonour which the Duke did
      her by keeping the lady; whereupon he said that of that, if she
      approved, he would certainly relieve her by seeing that the lady was
      removed from the villa to some distant place. <milestone id="p02070071" />The Duchess,
      supposing that Constantine was prompted not by jealousy of the
      Duke but by jealousy for her honour, gave her hearty consent to his
      plan, provided he so contrived that the Duke should never know that
      she had been privy to it; on which point Constantine gave her ample
      assurance. So, being authorised by the Duchess to act as he might
      deem best, <milestone id="p02070072" />he secretly equipped a light bark and manned her with
      some of his men, to whom he confided his plan, bidding them lie to
      off the garden of the lady's villa; and so, having sent the bark
      forward, he hied him with other of his men to the villa. He gained
      ready admission of the servants, and was made heartily welcome by
      the lady, who, at his desire, attended by some of her servants, walked
      with him and some of his comrades in the garden. <milestone id="p02070073" />By and by,
      feigning that he had a message for her from the Duke, he drew her
      aside towards a gate that led down to the sea, and which one of his
      confederates had already opened. A concerted signal brought the
      bark alongside, and to seize the lady and set her aboard the bark was
      but the work of an instant. Her retinue hung back as they heard
      Constantine menace with death whoso but stirred or spoke, and
      suffered him, protesting that what he did was done not to wrong the
      Duke but solely to vindicate his sister's honour, to embark with his
      men. <milestone id="p02070074" />The lady wept, of course, but Constantine was at her side,
      the rowers gave way, and the bark, speeding like a thing of life over
      the waves, made Egina shortly after dawn. <milestone id="p02070075" />There Constantine and
      <pb n="129" />the lady landed, she still lamenting her fatal beauty, and took a
      little
      rest and pleasure. Then, re-embarking, they continued their voyage,
      and in the course of a few days reached Chios, which Constantine,
      fearing paternal censure, and that he might be deprived of his fair
      booty, deemed a safe place of sojourn. So, after some days of repose
      the lady ceased to bewail her harsh destiny, and suffering Constantine
      to console her as his predecessors had done, began once more to enjoy
      the good gifts which Fortune sent her.</p><p><milestone id="p02070076" />Now while they thus dallied, Osbech, King of the Turks, who
      was perennially at war with the Emperor, came by chance to
      Smyrna; and there learning that Constantine was wantoning in
      careless ease at Chios with a lady of whom he had made prize, he
      made a descent by night upon the island with an armed flotilla.
      Landing his men in dead silence, he made captives of not a few of
      the Chians whom he surprised in their beds; others, who took the
      alarm and rushed to arms, he slew; and having wasted the whole
      island with fire, he shipped the booty and the prisoners, and sailed
      back to Smyrna. <milestone id="p02070077" />As there he overhauled the booty, he lit upon the
      fair lady, and knew her for the same that had been taken in bed
      and fast asleep with Constantine: whereat, being a young man,
      he was delighted beyond measure, and made her his wife out of
      hand with all due form and ceremony. And so for several months
      he enjoyed her.</p><p><milestone id="p02070078" />Now there had been for some time and still was a treaty pending
      between the Emperor and Basano, King of Cappadocia, whereby
      Basano with his forces was to fall on Osbech on one side while the
      Emperor attacked him on the other. Some demands made by
      Basano, which the Emperor deemed unreasonable, had so far retarded
      the conclusion of the treaty; but no sooner had the Emperor learned
      the fate of his son than, distraught with grief, he forthwith conceded
      the King of Cappadocia's demands, and was instant with him to fall
      at once upon Osbech while he made ready to attack him on the other
      side. <milestone id="p02070079" />Getting wind of the Emperor's design, Osbech collected his
      forces, and, lest he should be caught and crushed between the convergent
      armies of two most mighty potentates, advanced against the
      King of Cappadocia. The fair lady he left at Smyrna in the care of
      a faithful dependant and friend, and after a while joined battle with
      the King of Cappadocia, in which battle he was slain, and his army
      <pb n="130" />defeated and dispersed. Wherefore Basano with his victorious host
      advanced, carrying everything before him, upon Smyrna, and receiving
      everywhere the submission due to a conqueror.</p><p><milestone id="p02070080" />Meanwhile Osbech's dependant, by name Antioco, who had
      charge of the fair lady, was so smitten with her charms that, albeit
      he was somewhat advanced in years, he broke faith with his friend
      and lord, and allowed himself to become enamoured of her. He had
      the advantage of knowing her language, which counted for much with
      one who for some years had been, as it were, compelled to live the
      life of a deaf mute, finding none whom she could understand or by
      whom she might be understood; and goaded by passion, he in the
      course of a few days established such a degree of intimacy with her
      that in no long time it passed from friendship into love, so that their
      lord, far away amid the clash of arms and the tumult of the battle,
      was forgotten, and marvellous pleasure had they of one another
      between the sheets.</p><p><milestone id="p02070081" />However, news came at last of Osbech's defeat and death, and
      the victorious and unchecked advance of Basano, whose advent they
      were by no means minded to await. Wherefore, taking with them
      the best part of the treasure that Osbech had left there, they hied
      them with all possible secrecy to Rhodes. There they had not along
      abode before Antioco fell ill of a mortal disease. <milestone id="p02070082" />He had then with
      him a Cypriote merchant, an intimate and very dear friend, to whom,
      as he felt his end approach, he resolved to leave all that he possessed,
      including his dear lady. <milestone id="p02070083" />So, when he felt death imminent, he called
      them to him and said: <q direct="unspecified">'Tis now quite evident to me that my life
	is fast ebbing away; and sorely do I regret it, for never had I so much
	pleasure of life as now. Well content indeed I am in one respect,
	in that, as die I must, I at least die in the arms of the two persons
	whom I love more than any other in the world, to wit, in thine
	arms, dearest friend, and those of this lady, whom, since I have
	known her, I have loved more than myself. <milestone id="p02070084" />But yet 'tis grievous to
	me to know that I must leave her here in a strange land with none
	to afford her either protection or counsel; and but that I leave her
	with thee, who, I doubt not, wilt have for my sake no less care of her
	than thou wouldst have had of me, 'twould grieve me still more;
	wherefore with all my heart and soul I pray thee, that, if I die, thou
	take her with all else that belongs to me into thy charge, and so
	<pb n="131" />acquit thyself of thy trust as thou mayst deem conducive to
	the peace of my soul. <milestone id="p02070085" />And of thee, dearest lady, I entreat one
	favour, that I be not forgotten of thee, after my death, so that there
	whither I go it may still be my boast to be beloved here of the
	most beautiful lady that nature ever formed. Let me but die
	with these two hopes assured, and without doubt I shall depart in
	peace.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02070086" />Both the merchant and the lady wept to hear him thus speak,
      and, when he had done, comforted him, and promised faithfully, in the
      event of his death, to do even as he besought them. He died almost
      immediately afterwards, and was honourably buried by them. <milestone id="p02070087" />A
      few days sufficed the merchant to wind up all his affairs in Rhodes;
      and being minded to return to Cyprus aboard a Catalan boat that was
      there, he asked the fair lady what she purposed to do if he went back
      to Cyprus. The lady answered, that, if it were agreeable to him, she
      would gladly accompany him, hoping that for love of Antioco he
      would treat and regard her as his sister. <milestone id="p02070088" />The merchant replied that
      it would afford him all the pleasure in the world; and, to protect her
      from insult until their arrival in Cyprus, he gave her out as his wife,
      and, suiting action to word, slept with her on the boat in an alcove
      in a little cabin in the poop. <milestone id="p02070089" />Whereby that happened which on
      neither side was intended when they left Rhodes, to wit, that the
      darkness and the comfort and the warmth of the bed, forces of no
      mean efficacy, did so prevail with them that dead Antioco was forgotten
      alike as lover and as friend, and by a common impulse they
      began to wanton together, insomuch that before they were arrived
      at Baffa, where the Cypriote resided, they were indeed man and wife.
      At Baffa the lady tarried with the merchant a good while, 
      <milestone id="p02070090" />during
      which it so befell that a gentleman, Antigono by name, a man of
      ripe age and riper wisdom but no great wealth, being one that had
      had vast and various experience of affairs in the service of the King
      of Cyprus but had found fortune adverse to him, came to Baffa on
      business; and <milestone id="p02070091" />passing one day by the house where the fair lady was
      then living by herself, for the Cypriote merchant was gone to Armenia
      with some of his wares, he chanced to catch sight of the lady at
      one of the windows, and, being struck by her extraordinary beauty,
      regarded her attentively, and began to have some vague recollection
      of having seen her before, but could by no means remember where.
      <pb n="132" />
      <milestone id="p02070092" />The fair lady, however, so long the sport of Fortune, but now nearing
      the term of her woes, no sooner saw Antigono than she remembered
      to have seen him in her father's service, and in no mean
      capacity, at Alexandria. Wherefore she forthwith sent for him,
      hoping that by his counsel she might elude her merchant and be
      reinstated in her true character and dignity of princess. 
      <milestone id="p02070093" />When he
      presented himself, she asked him with some embarrassment whether
      he were, as she took him to be, Antigono of Famagosta. 
      <milestone id="p02070094" />He answered
      in the affirmative, adding: <q direct="unspecified">And of you, madam, I have a sort of
	recollection, though I cannot say where I have seen you; wherefore,
	so it irk you not, bring, I pray you, yourself to my remembrance.</q>
      <milestone id="p02070095" />Satisfied that it was Antigono himself, the lady in a flood of tears threw
      herself upon him to his no small amazement, and embraced his neck:
      then, after a little while, she asked him whether he had never seen
      her in Alexandria. The question awakened Antigono's memory; he
      at once recognised Alatiel, the Soldan's daughter, whom he had thought
      to have been drowned at sea, and would have paid her due homage;
      but she would not suffer it, and bade him be seated with her for a
      while. <milestone id="p02070096" />Being seated, he respectfully asked her, how, and when and
      whence she had come thither, seeing that all Egypt believed for
      certain that she had been drowned at sea some years before. 
      <milestone id="p02070097" /><q direct="unspecified">And
	would that so it had been,</q> said the lady, <q direct="unspecified">rather than I should
	have led the life that I have led; and so doubtless will my father
	say, if he shall ever come to know of it.</q> And so saying, she
      burst into such a flood of tears that 'twas a wonder to see. 
      <milestone id="p02070098" />Wherefore
      <milestone id="p02070099" />Antigono said to her: <q direct="unspecified">Nay but, madam, be not distressed
	before the occasion arises. I pray you, tell me the story of your
	adventures, and what has been the tenor of your life; perchance
	'twill prove to be no such matter but, God helping us, we may set it
	all straight.</q> <q direct="unspecified">Antigono,</q> said the fair lady, <q direct="unspecified">when I saw thee,
	'twas as if I saw my father, and 'twas the tender love by which I
	am holden to him that prompted me to make myself known to thee,
	though I might have kept my secret; and few indeed there are,
	whom to have met would have afforded me such pleasure as this
	which I have in meeting and recognising thee before all others;
	wherefore I will now make known to thee as to a father that which
	in my evil fortune I have ever kept close. <milestone id="p02070100" />If, when thou hast heard
	my story, thou seest any means whereby I may be reinstated in my
	<pb n="133" />
	former honour, I pray thee use it. If not, disclose to none that thou
	hast seen me or heard aught of me.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02070101" />Then, weeping between every word, she told him her whole
      story from the day of the shipwreck at Majorca to that hour.
      Antigono wept in sympathy, and then said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, as throughout
	this train of misfortunes you have happily escaped recognition, I
	undertake to restore you to your father in such sort that you shall be
	dearer to him than ever before, and be afterwards married to the King
	of Algarve. <milestone id="p02070102" /><q direct="unspecified">How?</q> she asked. Whereupon he explained to her
	in detail how he meant to proceed; and, lest delay should give
	occasion to another to interfere, he went back at once to Famagosta,
	and having obtained audience of the King, thus he spoke: <q direct="unspecified">Sire,
	  so please you, you have it in your power at little cost to yourself to
	  do a thing, which will at once redound most signally to your honour
	  and confer a great boon on me, who have grown poor in your
	  service.</q> 
	<milestone id="p02070103" /><q direct="unspecified">How?</q> asked the King. Then said Antigono: 
	<q direct="unspecified">At
	  Baffa is of late arrived a fair damsel, daughter of the Soldan, long
	  thought to be drowned, who to preserve her chastity has suffered
	  long and severe hardship. She is now reduced to poverty, and is
	  desirous of returning to her father. If you should be pleased to send
	  her back to him under my escort, your honour and my interest would
	  be served in high and equal measure; nor do I think that such a
	  service would ever be forgotten by the Soldan.</q>
      </q></p><p><milestone id="p02070104" />With true royal generosity the King forthwith signified his
      approval, and had Alatiel brought under honourable escort to Famagosta,
      where, attended by his Queen, he received her with every
      circumstance of festal pomp and courtly magnificence. Schooled by
      Antigono, she gave the King and Queen such a version of her
      adventures as satisfied their inquiries in every particular. 
      <milestone id="p02070105" />So, after a
      few days, the King sent her back to the Soldan under escort of
      Antigono, attended by a goodly company of honourable men and
      women; and of the cheer which the Soldan made her, and not her
      only but Antigono and all his company, it boots not to ask. When she
      was somewhat rested, the Soldan inquired how it was that she was
      yet alive, and where she had been so long without letting him know
      how it fared with her. <milestone id="p02070106" />Whereupon the lady, who had got Antigono's
      lesson by heart, answered thus: <q direct="unspecified">My father, 'twas perhaps the
	twentieth night after my departure from you when our ship parted her
	<pb n="134" />timbers in a terrible storm and went ashore nigh a place called
	Aguamorta, away there in the West: what was the fate of the men
	that were aboard our ship I know not, nor knew I ever; 
	<milestone id="p02070107" />I remember
	only, that, when day came, and I returned, as it were, from death to
	life, the wreck, having been sighted, was boarded by folk from all the
	country-side, intent on plunder; and I and two of my women were
	taken ashore, where the women were forthwith parted from me by
	the young men, nor did I ever learn their fate. Now hear my own.
	<milestone id="p02070108" />Struggling might and main, I was seized by two young men, who
	dragged me, weeping bitterly, by the hair of the head, towards a
	great forest; but, on sight of four men who were then passing that
	way on horseback, they forthwith loosed me and took to flight.
	<milestone id="p02070109" />Whereupon the four men, who struck me as persons of great
	authority, ran up to me; and much they questioned me, and much I
	said to them; but neither did they understand me, nor I them. So,
	after long time conferring together, they set me on one of their
	horses and brought me to a house, where dwelt a community of
	ladies, religious according to their law; and what the men may have
	said I know not, but there I was kindly received and ever honourably
	entreated by all; and with them I did afterwards most reverentially
	pay my devotions to St. Crescent-in-Hollow, who is held in great
	honour by the women of that country. <milestone id="p02070110" />When I had been some
	time with them, and had learned something of their language, they
	asked me who and whence I was: whereto I, knowing that I was in
	a convent, and fearing to be cast out as a foe to their law if I told the
	truth, answered that I was the daughter of a great gentleman of
	Cyprus, who had intended to marry me to a gentleman of Crete;
	but that on the voyage we had been driven out of our course and
	wrecked at Aguamorta. <milestone id="p02070111" />And so I continued, as occasion required,
	observing their usages with much assiduity, lest worse should befall
	me; but being one day asked by their superior, whom they call
 abbess, whether I was minded to go back to Cyprus, I answered that
	there was nought that I desired so much. <milestone id="p02070112" />However, so solicitous for
	my honour was the abbess, that there was none going to Cyprus to
	whom she would entrust me, until, two months or so ago, there
	arrived some worthy men from France, of whom one was a kinsman
	of the abbess, with their wives. They were on their way to visit the
	sepulchre where He whom they hold to be God was buried after He
	<pb n="135" />had suffered death at the hands of the Jews; and the abbess, learning
	their destination, prayed them to take charge of me, and restore me
	to my father in Cyprus. <milestone id="p02070113" />With what cheer, with what honour, these
	gentlemen and their wives entertained me, 'twere long to tell. <milestone id="p02070114" />But,
	in brief, we embarked, and in the course of a few days arrived at
	Baffa, where it was so ordered by the providence of God, who perchance
	took pity on me, that in the very hour of our disembarkation
	I, not knowing a soul and being at a loss how to answer the gentlemen,
	who would fain have discharged the trust laid upon them by
	the reverend abbess and restored me to my father, fell in, on the
	shore, with Antigono, whom I forthwith called, and in our language,
	that I might be understood neither of the gentlemen nor of their
	wives, bade him acknowledge me as his daughter. <milestone id="p02070115" />He understood
	my case at once, made much of me, and to the utmost of his
	slender power honourably requited the gentlemen. He then brought
	me to the King of Cyprus, who accorded me welcome there and
	conduct hither so honourable as words of mine can never describe. It
	aught remains to tell, you may best learn it from the lips of Antigono,
	who has often heard my story.</q>
    </p><p><milestone id="p02070116" />Then Antigono, addressing the Soldan, said: <q direct="unspecified">Sire, what she
 has told you accords with what she has often told me, and with
 what I have learned from the gentlemen and ladies who accompanied
 her. <milestone id="p02070117" />One thing, however, she has omitted, because, I suppose, it
 hardly becomes her to tell it; to wit, all that the gentlemen and
 ladies, who accompanied her, said of the virtuous and gracious and
 noble life which she led with the devout ladies, and of the tears and
 wailings of both the ladies and the gentlemen, when they parted
 with her to me. <milestone id="p02070118" />But were I to essay to repeat all that they said to
 me, the day that now is, and the night that is to follow, were all too
 short: suffice it to say so much as this, that, by what I gathered
 from their words and have been able to see for myself, you may make
 it your boast, that among all the daughters of all your peers that
 wear the crown none can be matched with yours for virtue and true
 worth.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02070119" />By all which the Soldan was so overjoyed that 'twas a wonder to
 see. Again and again he made supplication to God, that of His
 grace power might be vouchsafed him adequately to recompense all
 who had done honour to his daughter, and most especially the King
 <pb n="136" />of Cyprus, for the honourable escort under which he had sent her
 thither; for Antigono he provided a magnificent guerdon, and some
 days later gave him his cong&#232; to return to Cyprus, at the same
 time
 by a special ambassage conveying to the King his grateful acknowledgments
 of the manner in which he had treated his daughter.
 <milestone id="p02070120" />Then, being minded that his first intent, to wit, that his daughter
 should be the bride of the King of Algarve, should not be frustrate,
 he wrote to the King, telling him all, and adding that, if he were
 still minded to have her, he might send for her. <milestone id="p02070121" />The King was
 overjoyed by these tidings, and having sent for her with great pomp,
 gave her on her arrival a hearty welcome. So she, who had lain
 with eight men, in all, perhaps, ten thousand times, was bedded with
 him as a virgin, and made him believe that a virgin she was, and
 lived long and happily with him as his queen: <milestone id="p02070122" />wherefore 'twas
 said: <q direct="unspecified">Mouth, for kisses, was never the worse: like as the moon
 reneweth her course.</q></p></div2><pb n="137" /><div2 type="novella" who="elissa" id="nov0208"><head>Novel VIII</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02080001" />The Count of Antwerp, labouring under a false accusation,

	began:</p></div3><div3 who="elissa" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p02080003" />Vast indeed is the field that lies before us, wherein to roam
	at large; 'twould readily afford each of us not one course but ten,
	so richly has Fortune diversified it with episodes both strange and
	sombre; wherefore selecting one such from this infinite store, I
	say:</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02080004" />That, after the transference of the Roman Empire from the
 Franks to the Germans, the greatest enmity prevailed between the
 two nations, with warfare perpetual and relentless: wherefore,
 deeming that the offensive would be their best defence, the King of
 France and his son mustered all the forces they could raise from
 their own dominions and those of their kinsmen and allies, and
 arrayed a grand army for the subjugation of their enemies. Before
 <pb n="138" />they took the field, as they could not leave the realm without a
 governor, they chose for that office Gautier, Count of Antwerp, a
 true knight and sage counsellor, and their very loyal ally and vassal,
 choosing him the rather, because, albeit he was a thorough master of
 the art of war, yet they deemed him less apt to support its hardships
 than for the conduct of affairs of a delicate nature. Him, therefore,
 they set in their place as their vicar-general and regent of the whole
 realm of France, and having so done, they took the field.</p><p><milestone id="p02080005" />Count Gautier ordered his administration wisely and in a regular
 course, discussing all matters with the queen and her daughter-in-law;
 whom, albeit they were left under his charge and jurisdiction,
 he nevertheless treated as his ladies paramount. <milestone id="p02080006" />The Count was
 about forty years of age, and the very mould of manly beauty; in
 bearing as courteous and chivalrous as ever a gentleman might be,
 and withal so debonair and dainty, so feat and trim of person that
 he had not his peer among the gallants of that day. <milestone id="p02080007" />His wife was
 dead, leaving him two children and no more, to wit, a boy and a
 girl, still quite young. Now the King and his son being thus away
 at the war, and the Count frequenting the court of the two said
 ladies, and consulting with them upon affairs of state, it so befell
 that the Prince's lady regarded him with no small favour, being very
 sensible alike of the advantages of his person and the nobility of his
 bearing; whereby she conceived for him a passion which was all the
 more ardent because it was secret. <milestone id="p02080008" />And, as he was without a wife,
 and she was still in the freshness of her youth, she saw not why she
 should not readily be gratified; but supposing that nothing stood in
 the way but her own shamefastness, she resolved to be rid of that,
 and disclose her mind to him without any reserve. <milestone id="p02080009" />So one day,
 when she was alone, she seized her opportunity, and sent for him, as
 if she were desirous to converse with him on indifferent topics. <milestone id="p02080010" />The
 Count, his mind entirely aloof from the lady's purpose, presented
 himself forthwith, and at her invitation sate down by her side on a
 settee. They were quite alone in the room; but the Count had
 twice asked her the reason why she had so honoured him, before,
 overcome by passion, she broke silence, and crimson from brow to
 neck with shame, half sobbing, trembling in every limb, and faltering
 at every word, she thus spoke: 
<milestone id="p02080011" /><q direct="unspecified">Dearest friend and sweet my lord,
 sagacity such as yours cannot but be apt to perceive how great is the
 <pb n="139" />frailty of men and women, and how, for divers reasons, it varies in
 different persons in such a degree that no just judge would mete
 out the same measure to each indifferently, though the fault were
 apparently the same. 
<milestone id="p02080012" />Who would not acknowledge that a poor man
 or woman, fain to earn daily bread by the sweat of the brow, is far
 more reprehensible in yielding to the solicitations of love, than a
 rich lady, whose life is lapped in ease and unrestricted luxury? 
<milestone id="p02080013" />Not
 a soul, I am persuaded, but would so acknowledge! Wherefore I
 deem that the possession of these boons of fortune should go far
 indeed to acquit the possessor, if she, perchance, indulge an errant
 love; and, for the rest, that, if she have chosen a wise and worthy
 lover, she should be entirely exonerated. 
<milestone id="p02080014" />And as I think I may
 fairly claim the benefit of both these pleas, and of others beside, to
 wit, my youth and my husband's absence, which naturally incline me
 to love, 'tis meet that I now urge them in your presence in defence
 of my passion; and if they have the weight with you which they
 should have with the wise, I pray you to afford me your help and
 counsel in the matter wherein I shall demand it. <milestone id="p02080015" />I avow that in the
 absence of my husband I have been unable to withstand the promptings
 of the flesh and the power of love, forces of such potency that
 even the strongest men--not to speak of delicate women--have not
 seldom been, nay daily are, overcome by them; and so, living thus,
 as you see me, in ease and luxury, I have allowed the allurements of
 love to draw me on until at last I find myself a prey to passion.
 <milestone id="p02080016" />Wherein were I discovered, I were, I confess, dishonoured; but
 discovery being avoided, I count the dishonour all but nought.
 Moreover, love has been so gracious to me that not only has he
 spared to blind me in the choice of my lover, but he has even lent me
 his most effective aid, pointing me to one well worthy of the love of
 a lady such as I, even to yourself; <milestone id="p02080017" />whom, if I misread not my
 mind, I deem the most handsome and courteous and debonair, and
 therewithal the sagest cavalier that the realm of France may shew.
 And as you are without a wife, so may I say that I find myself
 without a husband. <milestone id="p02080018" />Wherefore in return for this great love I bear
 you, deny me not, I pray you, yours; but have pity on my youth,
 which wastes away for you like ice before the fire.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02080019" />These words were followed by such a flood of tears, that, albeit
 she had intended yet further to press her suit, speech failed her; her
 <pb n="140" />eyes drooped, and, almost swooning with emotion, she let her head
 fall upon the Count's breast. <milestone id="p02080020" />The Count, who was the most loyal
 of knights, began with all severity to chide her mad passion and to
 thrust her from him--for she was now making as if she would throw
 her arms around his neck--and to asseverate with oaths that he
 would rather be hewn in pieces than either commit, or abet another
 in committing such an offence against the honour of his lord; 
<milestone id="p02080021" />when
 the lady, catching his drift, and forgetting all her love in a sudden
 frenzy of rage, cried out: <q direct="unspecified">So! unknightly knight, is it thus you
 flout my love? Now Heaven forbid, but, as you would be the death
 of me, I either do you to death or drive you from the world!</q> 
<milestone id="p02080022" />So
 saying, she dishevelled and tore her hair and rent her garments to
 shreds about her bosom. Which done, she began shrieking at the top
 of her voice: <q direct="unspecified">Help! help! The Count of Antwerp threatens to
 violate me!</q> 
<milestone id="p02080023" />Whereupon the Count, who knew that a clear conscience
 was no protection against the envy of courtiers, and doubted that
 his innocence would prove scarce a match for the cunning of the
 lady, started to his feet, and hied him with all speed out of the room,
 out of the palace, and back to his own house. Counsel of none he
 sought; but forthwith set his children on horseback, and taking
 horse himself, departed post haste for Calais. 
<milestone id="p02080024" />The lady's cries
 brought not a few to her aid, who, observing her plight, not only
 gave entire credence to her story, but improved upon it, alleging that
 the debonair and accomplished Count had long employed all the arts
 of seduction to compass his end. So they rushed in hot haste to the
 Count's house, with intent to arrest him, and not finding him, sacked
 it and razed it to the ground. 
<milestone id="p02080025" />The news, as glosed and garbled,
 being carried to the King and Prince in the field, they were mightily
 incensed, and offered a great reward for the Count, dead or alive, and
 condemned him and his posterity to perpetual banishment.</p><p><milestone id="p02080026" />Meanwhile the Count, sorely troubled that by his flight his
 innocence shewed as guilt, pursued his journey, and concealing his
 identity, and being recognised by none, arrived with his two children
 at Calais. Thence he forthwith crossed to England, and, meanly
 clad, fared on for London, taking care as he went to school his
 children in all that belonged to their new way of life, and especially
 in two main articles: to wit, that they should bear with resignation
 the poverty to which, by no fault of theirs, but solely by one of
 <pb n="141" />Fortune's caprices, they and he were reduced, and that they should
 be most sedulously on their guard to betray to none, as they valued
 their lives, whence they were, or who their father was. 
<milestone id="p02080027" />The son,
 Louis by name, was perhaps nine, and the daughter, Violante, perhaps
 seven years of age. For years so tender they proved apt pupils, and
 afterwards shewed by their conduct that they had well learned their
 father's lesson. <milestone id="p02080028" />He deemed it expedient to change their names, and
 accordingly called the boy Perrot and the girl Jeannette. So, meanly
 clad, the Count and his two children arrived at London, and there
 made shift to get a living by going about soliciting alms in the guise
 of French mendicants.</p><p><milestone id="p02080029" />Now, as for this purpose they waited one morning outside a
      church, it so befell that a great lady, the wife of one of the marshals
      of the King of England, observed them, as she left the church, asking
      alms, and demanded of the Count whence he was, and whether
      the children were his. <milestone id="p02080030" />He answered that he was from Picardy, that
      the children were his, and that he had been fain to leave Picardy by
      reason of the misconduct of their reprobate elder brother. 
      <milestone id="p02080031" />The lady
      looked at the girl, who being fair, and of gentle and winning mien
      and manners, found much favour in her eyes. So the kind-hearted
      lady said to the Count: <q direct="unspecified">My good man, if thou art willing to
	leave thy little daughter with me, I like her looks so well that I will
	gladly take her; and if she grow up a good woman, I will see that
	she is suitably married when the right time comes.</q> 
      <milestone id="p02080032" />The Count
      was much gratified by the proposal, which he forthwith accepted,
      and parted with the girl, charging the lady with tears to take every
      care of her.</p><p>Having thus placed the girl with one in whom he felt sure that he
 might trust, he determined to tarry no longer in London; wherefore,
 taking Perrot with him and begging as he went, he made his way
 to Wales, not without great suffering, being unused to go afoot.
 <milestone id="p02080033" />Now in Wales another of the King's marshals had his court, maintaining
 great state and a large number of retainers; to which court
 the Count and his son frequently repaired, there to get food; 
<milestone id="p02080034" />and
 there Perrot, finding the marshal's son and other gentlemen's sons
 vying with one another in boyish exercises, as running and leaping,
 little by little joined their company, and shewed himself a match or
 more for them all in all their contests. <milestone id="p02080035" />The marshal's attention
 <pb n="142" />being thus drawn to him, he was well pleased with the boy's mien
 and bearing, and asked who he was. He was told that he was the
 son of a poor man who sometimes came there to solicit alms.
 Whereupon he asked the Count to let him have the boy, and the
 Count, to whom God could have granted no greater boon, readily
 consented, albeit he was very loath to part with Perrot.</p><p><milestone id="p02080036" />Having thus provided for his son and daughter, the Count
 resolved to quit the island; and did so, making his way as best he
 could to Stamford, in Ireland, where he obtained a menial's place in
 the service of a knight, retainer to one of the earls of that country,
 and so abode there a long while, doing all the irksome and wearisome
 drudgery of a lackey or groom.</p><p><milestone id="p02080037" />Meanwhile under the care of the gentle lady at London Violante
 or Jeannette increased, as in years and stature so also in beauty, and
 in such favour with the lady and her husband and every other
 member of the household and all who knew her that 'twas a
 wonder to see; nor was there any that, observing her bearing and
 manners, would not have said that estate or dignity there was none so
 high or honourable but she was worthy of it. <milestone id="p02080038" />So the lady, who, since
 she had received her from her father, had been unable to learn aught
 else about him than what he had himself told, was minded to marry
 her honourably according to what she deemed to be her rank. 
<milestone id="p02080039" />But
 God, who justly apportions reward according to merit, having
 regard to her noble birth, her innocence, and the load of suffering
 which the sin of another had laid upon her, ordered otherwise; and
 in His good providence, lest the young gentlewoman should be mated
 with a churl, permitted, we must believe, events to take the course
 they did.</p><p><milestone id="p02080040" />The gentle lady with whom Jeannette lived had an only son,
 whom she and her husband loved most dearly, as well because he was
 a son as for his rare and noble qualities, for in truth there were few
 that could compare with him in courtesy and courage and personal
 beauty. <milestone id="p02080041" />Now the young man marked the extraordinary beauty and
 grace of Jeannette, who was about six years his junior, and fell so
 desperately in love with her that he had no eyes for any other maiden;
 but, deeming her to be of low degree, he not only hesitated to ask her
 of his parents in marriage, but, fearing to incur reproof for indulging
 a passion for an inferior, he did his utmost to conceal his love.
 <pb n="143" />Whereby it gave him far more disquietude than if he had avowed
 it; <milestone id="p02080042" />insomuch that--so extreme waxed his suffering--he fell ill, and
 that seriously. Divers physicians were called in, but, for all their
 scrutiny of his symptoms, they could not determine the nature of
 his malady, and one and all gave him up for lost. <milestone id="p02080043" />Nothing could
 exceed the sorrow and dejection of his father and mother, who again
 and again piteously implored him to discover to them the cause of his
 malady, and received no other answer than sighs or complaints that
 he seemed to be wasting away. <milestone id="p02080044" />Now it so happened that one day,
 Jeannette, who from regard for his mother was sedulous in waiting
 upon him, for some reason or another came into the room where he
 lay, while a very young but very skilful physician sate by him and
 held his pulse. <milestone id="p02080045" />The young man gave her not a word or other sign
 of recognition; but his passion waxed, his heart smote him, and the
 acceleration of his pulse at once betrayed his inward commotion to
 the physician, who, albeit surprised, remained quietly attentive to see
 how long it would last, <milestone id="p02080046" />and observing that it ceased when Jeannette
 left the room, conjectured that he was on the way to explain the
 young man's malady. So, after a while, still holding the young
 man's pulse, he sent for Jeannette, as if he had something to ask
 of her. She returned forthwith; the young man's pulse mounted
 as soon as she entered the room, and fell again as soon as she left
 it. <milestone id="p02080047" />Wherefore the physician no longer hesitated, but rose, and
 taking the young man's father and mother aside, said to them:
 <q direct="unspecified">The restoration of your son's health rests not with medical skill,
 but solely with Jeannette, whom, as by unmistakable signs I have
 discovered, he ardently loves, though, so far I can see, she is not
 aware of it. So you know what you have to do, if you value his
 life.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080048" />The prospect thus afforded of their son's deliverance from
 death reassured the gentleman and his lady, albeit they were troubled,
 misdoubting it must be by his marriage with Jeannette. <milestone id="p02080049" />So, when
 the physician was gone, they went to the sick lad, and the lady
 thus spoke: <q direct="unspecified">My son, never would I have believed that thou
 wouldst have concealed from me any desire of thine, least of all
 if such it were that privation should cause thee to languish; for
 well assured thou shouldst have been and shouldst be, that I hold
 thee dear as my very self, and that whatever may be for thy
 contentment, even though it were scarce seemly, I would do it
 <pb n="144" />for thee; 
<milestone id="p02080050" />but, for all thou hast so done, God has shewn Himself
 more merciful to theeward than thyself, and, lest thou die of this
 malady, has given me to know its cause, which is nothing else than
 the excessive love which thou bearest to a young woman, be she
 who she may. <milestone id="p02080051" />Which love in good sooth thou needest not have
 been ashamed to declare; for it is but natural at thy age; and
 hadst thou not loved, I should have deemed thee of very little
 worth. <milestone id="p02080052" />So, my son, be not shy of me, but frankly discover to me
 thy whole heart; and away with this gloom and melancholy
 whereof thy sickness is engendered, and be comforted, and assure
 thyself that there is nought that thou mayst require of me which
 I will not do to give thee ease, so far as my powers may reach,
 seeing that thou art dearer to me than my own life. <milestone id="p02080053" />Away with
 thy shamefastness and fears, and tell me if there is aught wherein
 I may be helpful to thee in the matter of thy love; and if I bestir
 not myself and bring it to pass, account me the most harsh mother
 that ever bore son.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02080054" />The young man was at first somewhat shamefast to hear his
 mother thus speak, but, reflecting that none could do more for his
 happiness than she, he took courage, and thus spoke: <q direct="unspecified">Madam,
 my sole reason for concealing my love from you was that I have
 observed that old people for the most part forget that they once were
 young; <milestone id="p02080055" />but, as I see that no such unreasonableness is to be apprehended
 in you, I not only acknowledge the truth of what you say
 that you have discerned, but I will also disclose to you the object of
 my passion, on the understanding that your promise shall to the best
 of your power be performed, as it must be, if I am to be restored to
 you in sound health.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080056" />Whereupon the lady, making too sure of that
 which was destined to fall out otherwise than she expected, gave him
 every encouragement to discover all his heart, and promised to lose
 no time and spare no pains in endeavouring to compass his gratification.
 <milestone id="p02080057" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> said then the young man, <q direct="unspecified">the rare beauty and
 exquisite manners of our Jeannette, my powerlessness to make her
 understand--I do not say commiserate--my love, and my reluctance
 to disclose it to any, have brought me to the condition in which you
 see me; and if your promise be not in one way or another performed,
 be sure that my life will be brief.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080058" />The lady, deeming that the
 occasion called rather for comfort than for admonition, replied with a
 <pb n="145" />smile: <q direct="unspecified">Ah! my son, was this then of all things the secret of thy
 suffering? Be of good cheer, and leave me to arrange the affair,
 when you are recovered.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080059" />So, animated by a cheerful hope, the
 young man speedily gave sign of a most marked improvement, which
 the lady observed with great satisfaction, and then began to cast about
 how she might keep her promise. So one day she sent for Jeannette,
 and in a tone of gentle raillery asked her if she had a lover.
 <milestone id="p02080060" />Jeannette turned very red as she answered: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, 'twould scarce,
 nay, 'twould ill become a damsel such as I, poor, outcast from home,
 and in the service of another, to occupy herself with thoughts of
 love.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080061" />Whereto the lady answered: <q direct="unspecified">So you have none, we will
 give you one, who will brighten all your life and give you more joy
 of your beauty; for it is not right that so fair a damsel as you remain
 without a lover.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080062" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> rejoined Jeannette, <q direct="unspecified">you found me
 living in poverty with my father, you adopted me, you have brought
 me up as your daughter; wherefore I should, if possible, comply with
 your every wish; but in this matter I will render you no compliance,
 nor do I doubt that I do well. So you will give me a husband, I
 will love him, but no other will I love; for, as patrimony I now have
 none save my honour, that I am minded to guard and preserve while
 my life shall last.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080063" />Serious though the obstacle was which these
 words opposed to the plan by which the lady had intended to keep
 her promise to her son, her sound judgment could not but secretly
 acknowledge that the spirit which they evinced was much to be
 commended in the damsel. Wherefore she said: <q direct="unspecified">Nay but,
 Jeannette; suppose that our Lord the King, who is a young knight
 as thou art a most fair damsel, craved some indulgence of thy
 love, wouldst thou deny him?</q> 
<milestone id="p02080064" /><q direct="unspecified">The King,</q> returned Jeannette
 without the least hesitation, <q direct="unspecified">might constrain me, but with my
 consent he should never have aught of me that was not honourable.</q>
 <milestone id="p02080065" />Whereto the lady made no answer, for she now understood the girl's
 temper; but, being minded to put her to the proof, she told her son
 that, as soon as he was recovered, she would arrange that he should
 be closeted with her in the same room, and be thus able to use all his
 arts to bring her to his will, saying that it ill became her to play the
 part of procuress and urge her son's suit upon her own maid. 
<milestone id="p02080066" />But
 as the young man, by no means approving this idea, suddenly grew
 worse, the lady at length opened her mind to Jeannette, 
<milestone id="p02080067" />whom she
 <pb n="146" />found in the same frame as before, and indeed even more resolute.
 Wherefore she told her husband all that she had done; and as both
 preferred that their son should marry beneath him, and live, than that
 he should remain single and die, they resolved, albeit much disconcerted,
 to give Jeannette to him to wife; and so after long debate
 they did. <milestone id="p02080068" />Whereat Jeannette was overjoyed, and with devout heart
 gave thanks to God that He had not forgotten her; nevertheless she
 still gave no other account of herself than that she was the daughter
 of a Picard. So the young man recovered, and blithe at heart as
 ne'er another, was married, and began to speed the time gaily with
 his bride.</p><p><milestone id="p02080069" />Meanwhile Perrot, left in Wales with the marshal of the King
 of England, had likewise with increase of years increase of favour
 with his master, and grew up most shapely and well-favoured, and of
 such prowess that in all the island at tourney or joust or any other
 passage of arms he had not his peer; being everywhere known and
 renowned as Perrot the Picard. <milestone id="p02080070" />And as God had not forgotten
 Jeannette, so likewise He made manifest by what follows that He had
 not forgotten Perrot. Well-nigh half the population of those parts
 being swept off by a sudden visitation of deadly pestilence, most of the
 survivors fled therefrom in a panic, so that the country was, to all
 appearance, entirely deserted. <milestone id="p02080071" />Among those that died of the pest
 were the marshal, his lady, and his son, besides brothers and nephews
 and kinsfolk in great number; whereby of his entire household there
 were left only one of his daughters, now marriageable, and a few
 servants, among them Perrot. <milestone id="p02080072" />Now Perrot being a man of such
 notable prowess, the damsel, soon after the pestilence had spent
 itself, took him, with the approval and by the advice of the few folk
 that survived, to be her husband, and made him lord of all that fell
 to her by inheritance. <milestone id="p02080073" />Nor was it long before the King of England,
 learning that the marshal was dead, made Perrot the Picard, to whose
 merit he was no stranger, marshal in the dead man's room. Such,
 in brief, was the history of the two innocent children, with whom
 the Count of Antwerp had parted, never expecting to see them
 again.</p><p><milestone id="p02080074" />'Twas now the eighteenth year since the Count of Antwerp had
 taken flight from Paris, when, being still in Ireland, where he had
 led a very sorry and suffering sort of life, and feeling that age was
 <pb n="147" />now come upon him, he felt a longing to learn, if possible, what was
 become of his children. <milestone id="p02080075" />The fashion of his outward man was now
 completely changed; for long hardship had (as he well knew) given
 to his age a vigour which his youth, lapped in ease, had lacked. So
 he hesitated not to take his leave of the knight with whom he had
 so long resided, and poor and in sorry trim he crossed to England,
 and made his way to the place where he had left Perrot--to find him
 a great lord and marshal of the King, and in good health, and withal
 a hardy man and very handsome. All which was very grateful to
 the old man; but yet he would not make himself known to his son,
 until he had learned the fate of Jeannette. <milestone id="p02080076" />So forth he fared again,
 nor did he halt until he was come to London, where, cautiously
 questing about for news of the lady with whom he had left his
 daughter, and how it fared with her, he learned that Jeannette was
 married to the lady's son. Whereat, in the great gladness of his
 heart, he counted all his past adversity but a light matter, since
 he had found his children alive and prosperous. <milestone id="p02080077" />But sore he
 yearned to see Jeannette. Wherefore he took to loitering, as poor
 folk are wont, in the neighbourhood of the house. And so one
 day Jacques Lamiens--such was the name of Jeannette's husband--saw
 him and had pity on him, observing that he was poor and aged,
 and bade one of his servants take him indoors, and for God's sake
 give him something to eat; and nothing loath the servant did so.
 <milestone id="p02080078" />Now Jeannette had borne Jacques several children, the finest and the
 most winsome children in the world, the eldest no more than eight
 years old; who gathered about the Count as he ate, and, as if by
 instinct divining that he was their grandfather, began to make friends
 with him. <milestone id="p02080079" />He, knowing them for his grandchildren, could not
 conceal his love, and repaid them with caresses; insomuch that they
 would not hearken to their governor when he called them, but
 remained with the Count. Which being reported to Jeannette, she
 came out of her room, crossed to where the Count was sitting with
 the children, and bade them do as their master told them, or she
 would certainly have them whipped. <milestone id="p02080080" />The children began to cry,
 and to say that they would rather stay with the worthy man, whom
 they liked much better than their master; whereat both the lady and
 the Count laughed in sympathy. <milestone id="p02080081" />The Count had risen, with no
 other intention--for he was not minded to disclose his paternity--<pb n="148" />than
 to pay his daughter the respect due from his poverty to her
 rank, and the sight of her had thrilled his soul with a wondrous
 delight. By her he was and remained unrecognised; utterly
 changed as he was from his former self; aged, grey-haired, bearded,
 lean and tanned--in short to all appearance another man than the
 Count.</p><p><milestone id="p02080082" />However, seeing that the children were unwilling to leave him,
 but wept when she made as if she would constrain them, she bade
 the master let them be for a time. <milestone id="p02080083" />So the children remained with
 the worthy man, until by chance Jacques' father came home, and
 learned from the master what had happened. Whereupon, having a
 grudge against Jeannette, he said: <q direct="unspecified">Let them be; and God give
 them the ill luck which He owes them: whence they sprang, thither
 they must needs return; they descend from a vagabond on the
 mother's side, and so 'tis no wonder that they consort readily with
 vagabonds.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080084" />The Count caught these words and was sorely pained,
 but, shrugging his shoulders, bore the affront silently as he had borne
 many another. Jacques, who had noted his children's fondness for
 the worthy man, to wit, the Count, was displeased; but nevertheless,
 such was the love he bore them, that, rather than see them weep, he
 gave order that, if the worthy man cared to stay there in his service,
 he should be received. <milestone id="p02080085" />The Count answered that he would gladly
 do so, but that he was fit for nothing except to look after horses, to
 which he had been used all his life. So a horse was assigned him,
 and when he had groomed him, he occupied himself in playing with
 the children.</p><p><milestone id="p02080086" />While Fortune thus shaped the destinies of the Count of Antwerp
 and his children, it so befell that after a long series of truces
 made with the Germans the King of France died, and his crown
 passed to his son, whose wife had been the occasion of the Count's
 banishment. <milestone id="p02080087" />The new king, as soon as the last truce with the
 Germans was run out, renewed hostilities with extraordinary vigour,
 being aided by his brother of England with a large army under the
 command of his marshal, Perrot, and his other marshal's son,
 Jacques Lamiens. With them went the worthy man, that is to say,
 the Count, who, unrecognised by any, served for a long while in the
 army in the capacity of groom, and acquitted himself both in counsel
 and in arms with a wisdom and valour unwonted in one of his
 <pb n="149" />supposed rank. 
<milestone id="p02080088" />The war was still raging when the Queen of France
 fell seriously ill, and, as she felt her end approach, made a humble and
 contrite confession of all her sins to the Archbishop of Rouen, who
 was universally reputed a good and most holy man. Among her other
 sins she confessed the great wrong that she had done to the Count
 of Antwerp; <milestone id="p02080089" />nor was she satisfied to confide it to the Archbishop,
 but recounted the whole affair, as it had passed, to not a few other
 worthy men, whom she besought to use their influence with the
 King to procure the restitution of the Count, if he were still alive,
 and if not, of his children, to honour and estate. And so, dying
 shortly afterwards, she was honourably buried. 
<milestone id="p02080090" />The Queen's confession
 wrung from the King a sigh or two of compunction for a
 brave man cruelly wronged; after which he caused proclamation
 to be made throughout the army and in many other parts, that
 whoso should bring him tidings of the Count of Antwerp, or his
 children, should receive from him such a guerdon for each of them
 as should justly be matter of marvel; seeing that he held him
 acquitted, by confession of the Queen, of the crime for which he
 had been banished, and was therefore now minded to grant him not
 only restitution but increase of honour and estate.</p><p><milestone id="p02080091" />Now the Count, being still with the army in his character of
 groom, heard the proclamation, which he did not doubt was made
 in good faith. Wherefore he hied him forthwith to Jacques, and
 begged a private interview with him and Perrot, that he might discover
 to them that whereof the King was in quest. <milestone id="p02080092" />So the meeting
 was had; and Perrot was on the point of declaring himself, when
 the Count anticipated him: <q direct="unspecified">Perrot,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">Jacques here has
 thy sister to wife, but never a dowry had he with her. Wherefore
 that thy sister be not dowerless, 'tis my will that he, and no other,
 have this great reward which the King offers for thee, son, as he
 shall certify, of the Count of Antwerp, and for his wife and thy
 sister, Violante, and for me, Count of Antwerp, thy father.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080093" />So
 hearing, Perrot scanned the Count closely, and forthwith recognising
 him, burst into tears, and throwing himself at his feet embraced
 him, saying: <q direct="unspecified">My father, welcome, welcome indeed art thou.</q>
 <milestone id="p02080094" />Whereupon, between what he had heard from the Count and what
 he had witnessed on the part of Perrot, Jacques was so overcome
 with wonder and delight, that at first he was at a loss to know how
 <pb n="150" />to act. However, giving entire credence to what he had heard, and
 recalling insulting language which he had used towards the quondam
 groom, the Count, he was sore stricken with shame, and wept, and
 fell at the Count's feet, and humbly craved his pardon for all past
 offences; which the Count, raising him to his feet, most graciously
 granted him. <milestone id="p02080095" />So with many a tear and many a hearty laugh the
 three men compared their several fortunes; which done, Perrot and
 Jacques would have arrayed the Count in manner befitting his rank,
 but he would by no means suffer it, being minded that Jacques, so
 soon as he was well assured that the guerdon was forthcoming,
 should present him to the King in his garb of groom, that thereby
 the King might be the more shamed. <milestone id="p02080096" />So Jacques, with the Count
 and Perrot, went presently to the King and offered to present to him
 the Count and his children, provided the guerdon were forthcoming
 according to the proclamation. Jacques wondered not a little as
 forthwith at a word from the King a guerdon was produced ample
 for all three, and he was bidden take it away with him, so only that
 he should in very truth produce, as he had promised, the Count and
 his children in the royal presence. <milestone id="p02080097" />Then, withdrawing a little and
 causing his quondam groom, now Count, to come forward with
 Perrot, he said: <q direct="unspecified">Sire, father and son are before you; the daughter,
 my wife, is not here, but, God willing, you shall soon see her.</q> 
<milestone id="p02080098" />So
 hearing, the King surveyed the Count, whom, notwithstanding his
 greatly changed appearance, he at length recognised, and well-nigh
 moved to tears, he raised him from his knees to his feet, and kissed
 and embraced him. He also gave a kindly welcome to Perrot, and
 bade forthwith furnish the Count with apparel, servants and horses,
 suited to his rank; all which was no sooner said than done. 
<milestone id="p02080099" />Moreover
 the King shewed Jacques no little honour, and particularly
 questioned him of all his past adventures.</p><p><milestone id="p02080100" />As Jacques was about to take the noble guerdons assigned him for
 the discovery of the Count and his children, the Count said to
 him: <q direct="unspecified">Take these tokens of the magnificence of our Lord the
 King, and forget not to tell thy father that 'tis from no vagabond
 that thy children, his and my grandchildren, descend on the mother's
 side.</q> So Jacques took the guerdons, and sent for his wife and
 mother to join him at Paris. Thither also came Perrot's wife: and
 there with all magnificence they were entertained by the Count, to
 <pb n="151" />whom the King had not only restored all his former estates and
 honours, but added thereto others, whereby he was now become a
 greater man than he had ever been before. Then with the
 Count's leave they all returned to their several houses. The
 Count himself spent the rest of his days at Paris in greater glory
 than ever.</p></div2><pb n="152" /><div2 type="novella" who="filomena" id="nov0209"><head>Novel IX</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02090001" />Bernab&#242; of Genoa, deceived by Ambrogiuolo, loses his

 as merchants use, for divers reasons proper to each, at a hostelry in
 Paris, and having one evening jovially supped together, fell a talking
 <pb n="153" />of divers matters, and so, passing from one topic to another, they
 came at last to discuss the ladies whom they had left at home, 
<milestone id="p02090005" />and
 one jocosely said: <q direct="unspecified">I cannot answer for my wife; but for myself
 I own, that, whenever a girl that is to my mind comes in my way, I
 give the go-by to the love that I bear my wife, and take my pleasure
 of the new-comer to the best of my power.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090006" /><q direct="unspecified">And so do I,</q> said
 another, <q direct="unspecified">because I know that, whether I suspect her or no, my wife
 tries her fortune, and so 'tis do as you are done by; the ass and the
 wall are quits.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090007" />A third added his testimony to the same effect;
 and in short all seemed to concur in the opinion that the ladies they
 had left behind them were not likely to neglect their opportunities,
 <milestone id="p02090008" />when one, a Genoese, Bernab&#242; Lomellin by name, dissociated
 himself from the rest, affirming that by especial grace of God he was
 blessed with a wife who was, perhaps, the most perfect paragon to be
 found in Italy of all the virtues proper to a lady, ay, and in great
 measure, to a knight or squire; inasmuch as she was fair, still quite
 young, handy, hardy, and clever beyond all other women in
 embroidery work and all other forms of lady's handicraft. 
<milestone id="p02090009" />Moreover
 so well-mannered, discreet and sensible was she that she was as fit to
 wait at a lord's table as any squire or manservant or such like, the
 best and most adroit that could be found. <milestone id="p02090010" />To which encomium he
 added that she knew how to manage a horse, fly a hawk, read, write
 and cast up accounts better than as if she were a merchant; and after
 much more in the same strain of commendation he came at length to
 the topic of their conversation, asseverating with an oath that 'twas
 not possible to find a woman more honest, more chaste than she:
 nay, he verily believed that, if he remained from home for ten years,
 or indeed for the rest of his days, she would never think of any of
 these casual amours with any other man.</p><p><milestone id="p02090011" />Among the merchants who thus gossiped was a young man,
 Ambrogiuolo da Piacenza by name, who, when Bernab&#242; thus concluded
 his eulogy of his wife, broke out into a mighty laugh, and
 asked him with a leer, whether he of all men had this privilege by
 special patent of the Emperor. <milestone id="p02090012" />Bernab&#242; replied, somewhat angrily,
 that 'twas a boon conferred upon him by God, who was rather more
 powerful than the Emperor. <milestone id="p02090013" />To which Ambrogiuolo rejoined: <q direct="unspecified">I
 make no doubt, Bernab&#242;, that thou believest that what thou sayst is
 true; but, methinks, thou hast been but a careless observer of the
 <pb n="154" />nature of things; otherwise, I do not take thee to be of so gross
 understanding but that thou must have discerned therein reasons
 for speaking more judiciously of this matter. <milestone id="p02090014" />And that thou
 mayst not think that we, who have spoken with much freedom
 about our wives, deem them to be of another nature and mould
 than thine, but mayst know that we have but uttered what
 common sense dictates, I am minded to go a little further into
 this matter with thee. <milestone id="p02090015" />I have always understood, that of all mortal
 beings created by God man is the most noble, and next after him
 woman: man, then, being, as is universally believed, and is indeed
 apparent by his works, more perfect than woman, must without
 doubt be endowed with more firmness and constancy, women being
 one and all more mobile, for reasons not a few and founded in nature,
 which I might adduce, but mean for the present to pass over. 
<milestone id="p02090016" />And
 yet, for all his greater firmness, man cannot withstand--I do not say
 a woman's supplications, but--the mere lust of the eye which she
 unwittingly excites, and that in such sort that he will do all that is in
 his power to induce her to pleasure him, not once, perhaps, in the
 course of a month, but a thousand times a day. How, then, shouldst
 thou expect a woman, mobile by nature, to resist the supplications,
 the flatteries, the gifts, and all the other modes of attack that an
 accomplished seducer will employ? Thou thinkest that she may
 hold out! <milestone id="p02090017" />Nay verily, affirm it as thou mayst, I doubt thou dost not
 really so think. Thou dost not deny that thy wife is a woman, a
 creature of flesh and blood like the rest; and if so, she must have the
 same cravings, the same natural propensities as they, and no more
 force to withstand them; wherefore 'tis at least possible, that,
 however honest she be, she will do as others do; and nought that is
 possible admits such peremptory denial or affirmation of its contrary
 as this of thine.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02090018" />Whereto Bernab&#242; returned: <q direct="unspecified">I am a merchant and no philosopher,
 and I will give thee a merchant's answer. I acknowledge
 that what thou sayst is true of vain and foolish women who have no
 modesty, but such as are discreet are so sensitive in regard of their
 honour that they become better able to preserve it than men,
 who have no such solicitude; and my wife is one of this sort.</q>
 <milestone id="p02090019" /><q direct="unspecified">Doubtless,</q> observed Ambrogiuolo, <q direct="unspecified">few would be found to indulge
 in these casual amours, if every time they did so a horn grew out on
 <pb n="155" />the brow to attest the fact; but not only does no horn make its
 appearance but not so much as a trace or vestige of a horn, so only
 they be but prudent; and the shame and dishonour consist only in
 the discovery: wherefore, if they can do it secretly, they do it, or are
 fools to refrain. 
<milestone id="p02090020" />Hold it for certain that she alone is chaste who
 either had never suit made to her, or, suing herself, was repulsed.
 And albeit I know that for reasons true and founded in nature this
 must needs be, yet I should not speak so positively thereof as I do,
 had I not many a time with many a woman verified it by experience.
 And I assure thee that, had I but access to this most saintly wife of
 thine, I should confidently expect very soon to have the same success
 with her as with others.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090021" />Then Bernab&#242; angrily: <q direct="unspecified">'Twere long
 and tedious to continue this discussion. I should have my say, and
 thou thine, and in the end 'twould come to nothing. But, as thou
 sayst that they are all so compliant, and that thou art so accomplished
 a seducer, I give thee this pledge of the honour of my wife: I
 consent to forfeit my head, if thou shouldst succeed in bringing her
 to pleasure thee in such a sort; and shouldst thou fail, thou shalt
 forfeit to me no more than one thousand florins of gold.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02090022" />Elated by this unexpected offer, Ambrogiuolo replied: <q direct="unspecified">I know
 not what I should do with thy blood, Bernab&#242;, if I won the wager;
 but, if thou wouldst have proof of what I have told thee, lay five
 thousand florins of gold, which must be worth less to thee than thy
 head, against a thousand of mine, and, whereas thou makest no
 stipulation as to time, I will bind myself to go to Genoa, and within
 three months from my departure hence to have had my pleasure of
 thy wife, and in witness thereof to bring back with me, of the things
 which she prizes most dearly, evidence of her compliance so weighty
 and conclusive that thou thyself shalt admit the fact; nor do I
 require ought of thee but that thou pledge thy faith neither to come
 to Genoa nor to write word to her of this matter during the said
 three months.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090023" />Bernab&#242; professed himself well content; and though
 the rest of the company, seeing that the compact might well have
 very evil consequences, did all that they could to frustrate it, yet the
 two men were now so heated that, against the will of the others, they
 set it down fairly in writing, and signed it each with his own hand.
 <milestone id="p02090024" />This done, Ambrogiuolo, leaving Bernab&#242; at Paris, posted with all
 speed for Genoa. Arrived there, he set to work with great caution;
 <pb n="156" />and having found out the quarter in which the lady resided, he
 learned in the course of a few days enough about her habits of life
 and her character to know that what Bernab&#242; had told him was
 rather less than the truth. So, recognising that his enterprise was
 hopeless, he cast about for some device whereby he might cover his
 defeat; <milestone id="p02090025" />and having got speech of a poor woman, who was much in
 the lady's house, as also in her favour, he bribed her (other means
 failing) to convey him in a chest, which he had had made for the
 purpose, not only into the house but into the bedroom of the lady,
 whom the good woman, following Bernab&#242;'s instructions, induced to
 take charge of it for some days, during which, she said, she would be
 away.</p><p><milestone id="p02090026" />So the lady suffered the chest to remain in the room; and when
 the night was so far spent that Bernab&#242; thought she must be asleep,
 he opened it with some tools with which he had provided himself,
 and stole softly out. There was a light in the room, so that he was
 able to form an idea of its situation, to take note of the pictures and
 everything else of consequence that it contained, and to commit the
 whole to memory. <milestone id="p02090027" />This done, he approached the bed; and observing
 that the lady, and a little girl that was with her, were fast asleep, he
 gently uncovered her, and saw that nude she was not a whit less
 lovely than when dressed: he looked about for some mark that might
 serve him as evidence that he had seen her in this state, but found
 nothing except a mole, which she had under the left breast, and
 which was fringed with a few fair hairs that shone like gold. So
 beautiful was she that he was tempted at the hazard of his life to
 take his place by her side in the bed; <milestone id="p02090028" />but, remembering what he had
 heard of her inflexible obduracy in such affairs, he did not venture;
 but quietly replaced the bedclothes; and having passed the best part
 of the night very much at his ease in her room, he took from one of
 the lady's boxes a purse, a gown, a ring and a girdle, and with these
 tokens returned to the chest, and locked himself in as before. In
 this manner he passed two nights, nor did the lady in the least
 suspect his presence. <milestone id="p02090029" />On the third day the good woman came by
 preconcert to fetch her chest, and took it back to the place whence
 she had brought it. So Ambrogiuolo got out, paid her the stipulated
 sum, and hied him back with all speed to Paris, where he arrived
 within the appointed time. <milestone id="p02090030" />Then, in presence of the merchants
 <pb n="157" />who were witnesses of his altercation with Bernab&#242;, and the
 wager
 to which it had given occasion, he told Bernab&#242; that he had won
 the bet, having done what he had boasted that he would do; and in
 proof thereof he first of all described the appearance of the room and
 the pictures, and then displayed the articles belonging to the lady
 which he had brought away with him, averring that she had given
 them to him. <milestone id="p02090031" />Bernab&#242; acknowledged the accuracy of his description
 of the room, and that the articles did really belong to his wife, but
 objected that Ambrogiuolo might have learned characteristic features
 of the room from one of the servants, and have come by the things
 in a similar way, and therefore, unless he had something more to say,
 he could not justly claim to have won the bet. 
<milestone id="p02090032" /><q direct="unspecified">Verily,</q> rejoined
 Ambrogiuolo, <q direct="unspecified">this should suffice; but, as thou requirest that I say
 somewhat further, I will satisfy thee. I say, then, that Madam
 Zinevra, thy wife, has under her left breast a mole of some size,
 around which are, perhaps, six hairs of a golden hue.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090033" />As Bernab&#242;
 heard this, it was as if a knife pierced his heart, so poignant was his
 suffering; and, though no word escaped him, the complete alteration
 of his mien bore unmistakable witness to the truth of Ambrogiuolo's
 words. After a while he said: <q direct="unspecified">Gentlemen, 'tis even as Ambrogiuolo
 says; he has won the bet; he has but to come when
 he will, and he shall be paid.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090034" />And so the very next day
 Ambrogiuolo was paid in full, and Bernab&#242;, intent on wreaking
 vengeance on his wife, left Paris and set his face towards Genoa.
 He had no mind, however, to go home, and accordingly halted at an
 estate which he had some twenty miles from the city, whither he
 sent forward a servant, in whom he reposed much trust, with two
 horses and a letter advising the lady of his return, and bidding her
 come out to meet him. At the same time he gave the servant
 secret instructions to choose some convenient place, and ruthlessly
 put the lady to death, and so return to him. 
<milestone id="p02090035" />On his arrival at
 Genoa the servant delivered his message and the letter to the lady,
 who received him with great cheer, and next morning got on
 horseback and set forth with him for her husband's estate. 
<milestone id="p02090036" />So they
 rode on, talking of divers matters, until they came to a deep gorge,
 very lonely, and shut in by high rocks and trees. The servant,
 deeming this just the place in which he might without risk of
 discovery fulfil his lord's behest, whipped out a knife, and seizing
 <pb n="158" />the lady by the arm, said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, commend your soul to God,
 for here must end at once your journey and your life.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090037" />Terror-stricken
 by what she saw and heard, the lady cried out: <q direct="unspecified">Mercy
 for God's sake; before thou slay me, tell me at least wherein I have
 wronged thee, that thou art thus minded to put me to death.</q>
 <milestone id="p02090038" /><q direct="unspecified">Madam,</q> said the servant, <q direct="unspecified">me you have in no wise wronged;
 but your husband--how you may have wronged him I know not--charged
 me shew you no mercy, but to slay you on this journey,
 and threatened to have me hanged by the neck, should I not do so.
 You know well how bound I am to him, and that I may not
 disobey any of his commands: God knows I pity you, but yet I can
 no otherwise.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090039" />Whereat the lady burst into tears, saying: <q direct="unspecified">Mercy
 for God's sake; make not thyself the murderer of one that has done
 thee no wrong, at the behest of another. The all-seeing God knows
 that I never did aught to merit such requital at my husband's hands.
 <milestone id="p02090040" />But enough of this for the present: there is a way in which thou
 canst serve at once God and thy master and myself, if thou wilt do
 as I bid thee: take, then, these clothes of mine and give me in
 exchange just thy doublet and a hood; and carry the clothes with
 thee to my lord and thine, and tell him that thou hast slain me;
 and I swear to thee by the life which I shall have received at thy
 hands, that I will get me gone, and there abide whence news of me
 shall never reach either him or thee or these parts.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090041" />The servant,
 being loath to put her to death, soon yielded to pity; and so he took
 her clothes, allowing her to retain a little money that she had, and
 gave her one of his worser doublets and a hood; then, praying her
 to depart the country, he left her afoot in the gorge, and returned
 to his master, whom he gave to understand that he had not only
 carried out his orders but had left the lady's body a prey to wolves.
 Bernab&#242; after a while returned to Genoa, where, the supposed
 murder being bruited abroad, he was severely censured.</p><p><milestone id="p02090042" />Alone and disconsolate, the lady, as night fell, disguised herself
 as best she could, and hied her to a neighbouring village, where,
 having procured what was needful from an old woman, she shortened
 the doublet and fitted it to her figure, converted her chemise into a
 pair of breeches, cut her hair close, and, in short, completely disguised
 herself as a sailor. She then made her way to the coast, where by
 chance she encountered a Catalan gentleman, by name Segner
 <pb n="159" />Encararch, who had landed from one of his ships, which lay in the
 offing, to recreate himself at Alba, where there was a fountain. 
<milestone id="p02090043" />So
 she made overture to him of her services, was engaged and taken
 aboard the ship, assuming the name Sicurano da Finale. The
 gentleman put her in better trim as to clothes, and found her so apt
 and handy at service that he was exceeding well pleased with her.</p><p><milestone id="p02090044" />Not long afterwards the Catalan sailed one of his carracks to
 Alexandria. He took with him some peregrine falcons, which he
 presented to the Soldan, who feasted him once or twice; and noting
 with approbation the behaviour of Sicurano, who always attended
 his master, he craved him of the Catalan, which request the Catalan
 reluctantly granted. <milestone id="p02090045" />Sicurano proved so apt for his new service
 that he was soon as high in grace and favour with the Soldan as he
 had been with the Catalan. Wherefore, when the time of year
 came at which there was wont to be held at Acre, then under the
 Soldan's sway, a great fair, much frequented by merchants, Christian
 and Saracen alike, and to which, for the security of the merchants
 and their goods, the Soldan always sent one of his great officers of
 state with other officers and a guard to attend upon them, 
<milestone id="p02090046" />he determined
 to send Sicurano, who by this time knew the language very
 well. 
<milestone id="p02090047" />So Sicurano was sent to Acre as governor and captain of the
 guard for the protection of the merchants and merchandise. Arrived
 there, he bestirred himself with great zeal in all matters appertaining
 to his office; and as he went his rounds of inspection, he espied
 among the merchants not a few from Italy, Sicilians, Pisans, Genoese,
 Venetians, and so forth, with whom he consorted the more readily
 because they reminded him of his native land. 
<milestone id="p02090048" />And so it befell that,
 alighting once at a shop belonging to some Venetian merchants, he
 saw there among other trinkets a purse and a girdle, which he
 forthwith recognised as having once been his own. Concealing
 his surprise, he blandly asked whose they were, and if they were
 for sale. <milestone id="p02090049" />He was answered by Ambrogiuolo da Piacenza, who had
 come thither with much merchandise aboard a Venetian ship, and
 hearing that the captain of the guard was asking about the ownership
 of the purse and girdle, came forward, and said with a smile: <q direct="unspecified">The
 things are mine, Sir, and I am not disposed to sell them, but, if they
 take your fancy, I will gladly give them to you.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090050" />Observing the
 smile, Sicurano misdoubted that something had escaped him by
 <pb n="160" />which Ambrogiuolo had recognised him; but he answered with a
 composed air: <q direct="unspecified">Thou dost smile, perchance, to see me, a soldier,
 come asking about this woman's gear?</q> 
<milestone id="p02090051" /><q direct="unspecified">Not so, Sir,</q> returned
 Ambrogiuolo; <q direct="unspecified">I smile to think of the manner in which I came
 by it.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090052" /><q direct="unspecified">And pray,</q> said Sicurano, <q direct="unspecified">if thou hast no reason to
 conceal it, tell me, in God's name, how thou didst come by the
 things.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090053" /><q direct="unspecified">Why, Sir,</q> said Ambrogiuolo, <q direct="unspecified">they were given me by
 a Genoese lady, with whom I once spent a night, Madam Zinevra
 by name, wife of Bernab&#242; Lomellin, who prayed me to keep them
 as a token of her love. 
<milestone id="p02090054" />I smiled just now to think of the folly of
 Bernab&#242;, who was so mad as to stake five thousand florins of gold
 against my thousand that I could not bring his wife to surrender to
 me; which I did. I won the bet; and he, who should rather have
 been punished for his insensate folly, than she for doing what all
 women do, had her put to death, as I afterwards gathered, on his
 way back from Paris to Genoa.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02090055" />Ambrogiuolo had not done speaking before Sicurano had discerned
 in him the evident cause of her husband's animosity against
 her, and all her woe, and had made up her mind that he should
 not escape with impunity. <milestone id="p02090056" />She therefore feigned to be much
 interested by this story, consorted frequently and very familiarly
 with Ambrogiuolo, and insidiously captured his confidence, insomuch
 that at her suggestion, when the fair was done, he, taking with
 him all his wares, accompanied her to Alexandria, where she
 provided him with a shop, and put no little of her own money in
 his hands; so that he, finding it very profitable, was glad enough
 to stay. <milestone id="p02090057" />Anxious to make her innocence manifest to Bernab&#242;,
 Sicurano did not rest until, with the help of some great Genoese
 merchants that were in Alexandria, she had devised an expedient
 to draw him thither. Her plan succeeded; Bernab&#242; arrived; and,
 as he was now very poor, she privily arranged that he should be
 entertained by one of her friends until occasion should serve to carry
 out her design. <milestone id="p02090058" />She had already induced Ambrogiuolo to tell his
 story to the Soldan, and the Soldan to interest himself in the matter.
 So Bernab&#242; being come, and further delay inexpedient, she seized
 her opportunity, and persuaded the Soldan to cite Ambrogiuolo and
 Bernab&#242; before him, that in Bernab&#242;'s presence Ambrogiuolo
 might
 be examined of his boast touching Bernab&#242;'s wife, and the truth
 <pb n="161" />thereof, if not to be had from him by gentle means, be elicited by
 torture. <milestone id="p02090059" />So the Soldan, having Ambrogiuolo and Bernab&#242; before
 him, amid a great concourse of his people questioned Ambrogiuolo
 of the five thousand florins of gold that he had won from Bernab&#242;,
 and sternly bade him tell the truth. Still more harsh was the
 aspect of Sicurano, in whom Ambrogiuolo had placed his chief
 reliance, but who now threatened him with the direst torments if
 the truth were not forthcoming. <milestone id="p02090060" />Thus hard bested on this side and
 on that, and in a manner coerced, Ambrogiuolo, thinking he had
 but to refund, in presence of Bernab&#242; and many others accurately
 recounted the affair as it had happened. <milestone id="p02090061" />When he had done, Sicurano,
 as minister of the Soldan for the time being, turned to Bernab&#242; and
 said: <q direct="unspecified">And thy wife, thus falsely accused, what treatment did she
 meet with at thy hands?</q> 
<milestone id="p02090062" /><q direct="unspecified">Mortified,</q> said Bernab&#242;, <q direct="unspecified">by the
 loss
 of my money, and the dishonour which I deemed to have been
 done me by my wife, I was so overcome by wrath that I had her put
 to death by one of my servants, who brought me word that her
 corpse had been instantly devoured by a pack of wolves.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02090063" />Albeit the Soldan had heard and understood all that had passed,
 yet he did not as yet apprehend the object for which Sicurano had
 pursued the investigation. Wherefore Sicurano thus addressed him:
 <milestone id="p02090064" /><q direct="unspecified">My lord, what cause this good lady has to boast of her lover and
 her husband you have now abundant means of judging; seeing that
 the lover at one and the same time despoils her of her honour,
 blasting her fair fame with slanderous accusations, and ruins her
 husband; who, more prompt to trust the falsehood of another than
 the verity of which his own long experience should have assured
 him, devotes her to death and the devouring wolves; and, moreover,
 such is the regard, such the love which both bear her that, though
 both tarry a long time with her, neither recognises her. 
<milestone id="p02090065" />However,
 that you may know full well what chastisements they have severally
 deserved, I will now cause her to appear in your presence and theirs,
 provided you, of your especial grace, be pleased to punish the deceiver
 and pardon the deceived.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090066" />The Soldan, being minded in this matter
 to defer entirely to Sicurano, answered that he was well content,
 and bade produce the lady. Bernab&#242;, who had firmly believed that
 she was dead, was lost in wonder; likewise Ambrogiuolo, who now
 divined his evil plight, and dreading something worse than the
 <pb n="162" />disbursement of money, knew not whether to expect the lady's advent
 with fear or with hope. His suspense was not of long duration; 
<milestone id="p02090067" />for,
 as soon as the Soldan signified his assent, Sicurano, weeping, threw
 herself on her knees at his feet, and discarding the tones, as she
 would fain have divested herself of the outward semblance, of a man,
 said: 
<milestone id="p02090068" />.<q direct="unspecified">My lord, that forlorn, hapless Zinevra am I, falsely and
 foully slandered by this traitor Ambrogiuolo, and by my cruel
 and unjust husband delivered over to his servant to slaughter and
 cast out as a prey to the wolves; for which cause I have now for
 six years been a wanderer on the face of the earth in the guise of
 a man.</q> 
<milestone id="p02090069" />Then rending her robes in front and baring her breast, she
 made it manifest to the Soldan and all others who were present,
 that she was indeed a woman; then turning to Ambrogiuolo she
 haughtily challenged him to say when she had ever lain with him,
 as he had boasted. Ambrogiuolo said never a word, for he now
 recognised her, and it was as if shame had reft from him the power
 of speech. 
<milestone id="p02090070" />The Soldan, who had never doubted that Sicurano was
 a man, was so wonder-struck by what he saw and heard that at
 times he thought it must be all a dream. But, as wonder gave
 place to conviction of the truth, he extolled in the amplest terms the
 constancy and virtue and seemliness with which Zinevra, erstwhile
 Sicurano, had ordered her life. 
<milestone id="p02090071" />He then directed that she should
 be most nobly arrayed in the garb of her sex and surrounded by a
 bevy of ladies. Mindful of her intercession, he granted to Bernab&#242;
 the life which he had forfeited; and she, when Bernab&#242; threw
 himself at her feet and wept and craved her pardon, raised him,
 unworthy though he was, to his feet and generously forgave him,
 and tenderly embraced him as her husband. <milestone id="p02090072" />Ambrogiuolo the
 Soldan commanded to be bound to a stake, that his bare flesh,
 anointed with honey, might be exposed to the sun on one of the
 heights of the city, there to remain until it should fall to pieces
 of its own accord: and so 'twas done. <milestone id="p02090073" />He then decreed that the
 lady should have the traitor's estate, which was worth not less but
 rather more than ten thousand doubloons; whereto he added, in
 jewels and vessels of gold and silver and in money, the equivalent
 of upwards of other ten thousand doubloons, having first entertained
 her and her husband with most magnificent and ceremonious cheer,
 accordant with the lady's worth. <milestone id="p02090074" />Which done, he placed a ship at
 <pb n="163" />their disposal, and gave them leave to return to Genoa at their
 pleasure. So to Genoa they returned very rich and happy, and
 were received with all honour, especially Madam Zinevra, whom
 all the citizens had believed to be dead, and whom thenceforth, so
 long as she lived, they held of great consequence and excellency.
 <milestone id="p02090075" />As for Ambrogiuolo, the very same day that he was bound to the
 stake, the honey with which his body was anointed attracted such
 swarms of flies, wasps and gadflies, wherewith that country abounds,
 that not only was his life sucked from him but his very bones were
 completely denuded of flesh; in which state, hanging by the sinews,
 they remained a long time undisturbed, for a sign and a testimony
 of his baseness to all that passed by. And so the deceived had the
 better of the deceiver.</p></div2><pb n="164" /><div2 type="novella" who="dioneo" id="nov0210"><head>Novel X</head><argument><p><milestone id="p02100001" />Paganino da Monaco carries off the wife of Messer

 on this wise:</p></div3><div3 who="dioneo" type="commentary"><p><milestone id="p02100003" />Fair ladies, there is that in the queen's story which has caused

	imagination that, while they go about the world, taking their

	of the bent of their desires. <milestone id="p02100004" />Wherefore, by my story I purpose
	at one and the same time to shew you how great is the folly of

	bring that to pass which is beyond their power, and strive might
	and main to conform others to their own pattern, however little
	<pb n="165" />the nature of the latter may brook such treatment.</p></div3><p><milestone id="p02100005" />Know then
 that there was in Pisa a judge, better endowed with mental than
 with physical vigour, by name Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica, who,
 being minded to take a wife, and thinking, perhaps, to satisfy her
 by the same resources which served him for his studies, was to be
 suited with none that had not both youth and beauty, qualities
 which he would rather have eschewed, if he had known how to
 give himself as good counsel as he gave to others. However, being
 very rich, he had his desire. 
<milestone id="p02100006" />Messer Lotto Gualandi gave him in
 marriage one of his daughters, Bartolomea by name, a maid as fair
 and fit for amorous dalliance as any in Pisa, though few maids be
 there that do not shew as spotted lizards. 
<milestone id="p02100007" />The judge brought her
 home with all pomp and ceremony, and had a brave and lordly
 wedding; but in the essay which he made the very first night to
 serve her so as to consummate the marriage he made a false move,
 and drew the game much to his own disadvantage; for next morning
 his lean, withered and scarce animate frame was only to be
 re-quickened by draughts of vernaccia,<note>A strong white wine.</note>
 artificial restoratives and the
 like remedies. 
<milestone id="p02100008" />So, taking a more sober estimate of his powers than
 he had been wont, the worthy judge began to give his wife lessons
 from a calendar, which might have served as a horn-book, and
 perhaps had been put together at Ravenna:<note>The saying went, that owing
 to the multitude of churches at Ravenna
 every day was there a saint's day.</note> 
<milestone id="p02100009" />inasmuch as, according
 to his shewing, there was not a day in the year but was sacred,
 not to one saint only, but to many; in honour of whom for divers
 reasons it behoved men and women to abstain from carnal intercourse;
 whereto he added fast-days, Ember-days, vigils of Apostles
 and other saints, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the whole of Lent,
 certain lunar mansions, and many other exceptions, arguing perchance,
 that the practice of men with women abed should have
 its times of vacation no less than the administration of the law.
 <milestone id="p02100010" />In this method, which caused the lady grievous dumps, he long
 persisted, hardly touching her once a month, and observing her
 closely, lest another should give her to know working-days, as he
 had taught her holidays.</p><pb n="166" /><p><milestone id="p02100011" />Now it so befell that, one hot season, Messer Ricciardo thought
 he would like to visit a very beautiful estate which he had near
 Monte Nero, there to take the air and recreate himself for some
 days, and thither accordingly he went with his fair lady. 
<milestone id="p02100012" />While
 there, to amuse her, he arranged for a day's fishing; and so, he in
 one boat with the fishermen, and she in another with other ladies,
 they put out to watch the sport, which they found so delightsome,
 that almost before they knew where they were they were some miles
 out to sea. <milestone id="p02100013" />And while they were thus engrossed with the sport, a
 galliot of Paganino da Mare, a very famous corsair of those days,
 hove in sight and bore down upon the boats, and, for all the speed
 they made, came up with that in which were the ladies; and on
 sight of the fair lady Paganino, regardless of all else, bore her off to
 his galliot before the very eyes of Messer Ricciardo, who was by this
 time ashore, and forthwith was gone. <milestone id="p02100014" />The chagrin of the judge,
 who was jealous of the very air, may readily be imagined. But
 'twas to no purpose that, both at Pisa and elsewhere, he moaned and
 groaned over the wickedness of the corsairs, for he knew neither by
 whom his wife had been abducted, nor whither she had been taken.
 <milestone id="p02100015" />Paganino, meanwhile, deemed himself lucky to have gotten so
 beautiful a prize; and being unmarried, he was minded never to
 part with her, and addressed himself by soft words to soothe the
 sorrow which kept her in a flood of tears. <milestone id="p02100016" />Finding words of little
 avail, he at night passed--the more readily that the calendar had
 slipped from his girdle, and all feasts and holidays from his  mind--to
 acts of love, and on this wise administered consolation so effective
 that before they were come to Monaco she had completely forgotten
 the judge and his canons, and had begun to live with Paganino as
 merrily as might be. So he brought her to Monaco, where, besides
 the daily and nightly solace which he gave her, he honourably
 entreated her as his wife.</p><p><milestone id="p02100017" />Not long afterwards Messer Ricciardo coming to know where
 his wife was, and being most ardently desirous to have her back, and
 thinking none but he would understand exactly what to do in the
 circumstances, determined to go and fetch her himself, being prepared
 to spend any sum of money that might be demanded by way of
 ransom. So he took ship, and being come to Monaco, he both saw
 her and was seen by her; which news she communicated to
 <pb n="167" />Paganino in the evening, and told him how she was minded to
 behave. <milestone id="p02100018" />Next morning Messer Ricciardo, encountering Paganino,
 made up to him; and soon assumed a very familiar and friendly air,
 while Paganino pretended not to know him, being on his guard to see
 what he would be at. So Messer Ricciardo, as soon as he deemed
 the time ripe, as best and most delicately he was able, disclosed to
 Paganino the business on which he had come, praying him to take
 whatever in the way of ransom he chose and restore him the lady.
 <milestone id="p02100019" />Paganino replied cheerily: <q direct="unspecified">Right glad I am to see you here, Sir;
 and briefly thus I answer you: True it is that I have here a young
 woman; whether she be your wife or another man's, I know not,
 for you are none of my acquaintance, nor is she, except for the short
 time that she has been with me. <milestone id="p02100020" />If, as you say, you are her husband,
 why, as you seem to me to be a pleasant gentleman, I will even take
 you to her, and I doubt not she will know you well; if she says that
 it is even as you say, and is minded to go with you, you shall give
 me just what you like by way of ransom, so pleasant have I found
 you; otherwise 'twill be churlish in you to think of taking her from
 me, who am a young man, and as fit to keep a woman as another,
 and moreover never knew any woman so agreeable.</q> 
<milestone id="p02100021" /><q direct="unspecified">My wife,</q>
 said Ricciardo, <q direct="unspecified">she is beyond all manner of doubt, as thou shalt
 see; for so soon as thou bringest me to her, she will throw her arms
 about my neck; wherefore as thou art minded, even so be it; I ask
 no more.</q> 
<milestone id="p02100022" /><q direct="unspecified">Go we then,</q> said Paganino; 
<milestone id="p02100023" />and forthwith they
 went into the house, and Paganino sent for the lady while they
 waited in one of the halls. By and by she entered from one of the
 adjoining rooms all trim and tricked out, and advanced to the place
 where Paganino and Messer Ricciardo were standing, but never a
 word did she vouchsafe to her husband, any more than if he had been
 some stranger whom Paganino had brought into the house. Whereat
 the judge was mightily amazed, having expected to be greeted by
 her with the heartiest of cheer, and began to ruminate thus:
 Perhaps I am so changed by the melancholy and prolonged heartache,
 to which I have been a prey since I lost her, that she does not
 recognise me. 
<milestone id="p02100024" />Wherefore he said: <q direct="unspecified">Madam, cause enough have
 I to rue it that I took thee a fishing, for never yet was known such
 grief as has been mine since I lost thee; and now it seems as if thou
 dost not recognise me, so scant of courtesy is thy greeting. Seest
 <pb n="168" />thou not that I am thy Messer Ricciardo, come hither prepared to
 pay whatever this gentleman, in whose house we are, may demand,
 that I may have thee back and take thee away with me: and he is
 so good as to surrender thee on my own terms?</q> 
<milestone id="p02100025" />The lady turned
 to him with a slight smile, and said: <q direct="unspecified">Is it to me you speak, Sir?
 Bethink you that you may have mistaken me for another, for I, for
 my part, do not remember ever to have seen you.</q> 
<milestone id="p02100026" /><q direct="unspecified">Nay,</q> said
 Messer Ricciardo, <q direct="unspecified">but bethink thee what thou sayst; scan me
 closely; and if thou wilt but search thy memory, thou wilt find that
 I am thy Ricciardo di Chinzica.</q> 
<milestone id="p02100027" /><q direct="unspecified">Your pardon, Sir,</q> answered
 the lady, <q direct="unspecified">'tis not, perhaps, as seemly for me, as you imagine, to
 gaze long upon you; but I have gazed long enough to know that I
 never saw you before.</q> 
<milestone id="p02100028" />Messer Ricciardo supposed that she so spoke
 for fear of Paganino, in whose presence she durst not acknowledge
 that she knew him: so, after a while, he craved as a favour of
 Paganino that he might speak with her in a room alone. 
<milestone id="p02100029" />Which
 request Paganino granted, so only that he did not kiss her against her
 will. He then bade the lady go with Messer Ricciardo into a room
 apart, and hear what he had to say, and give him such answer as she
 deemed meet. <milestone id="p02100030" />So the lady and Messer Ricciardo went together into
 a room alone, and sate down, and Messer Ricciardo began on this
 wise: <q direct="unspecified">Ah! dear heart of me, sweet soul of me, hope of me, dost
 not recognise thy Ricciardo that loves thee better than himself?
 how comes it thus to pass? am I then so changed? Ah! goodly
 eye of me, do but look on me a little.</q> 
<milestone id="p02100031" />Whereat the lady burst into
 a laught, and interrupting him, said: <q direct="unspecified">Rest assured that my memory
 is not so short but that I know you for what you are, my husband,
 Messer Ricciardo di Chinzica; but far enough you shewed yourself
 to be, while I was with you, from knowing me for what I was,
 young, lusty, lively; which, had you been the wise man you would
 fain be reputed, you would not have ignored, nor by consequence
 that which, besides food and clothing, it behoves men to give young
 ladies, albeit for shame they demand it not; which in what sort you
 gave, you know. <milestone id="p02100032" />You should not have taken a wife if she was to
 be less to you than the study of the law, albeit 'twas never as a judge
 that I regarded you, but rather as a bellman of enc&#230;nia and saints'
 days, so well you knew them all, and fasts and vigils. And I tell
 you that, had you imposed the observance of as many saints' days on
 <pb n="169" />the labourers that till your lands as on yourself who had but my little
 plot to till, you would never have harvested a single grain of corn.
 <milestone id="p02100033" />God in His mercy, having regard unto my youth, has caused me to
 fall in with this gentleman, with whom I am much closeted in this
 room, where nought is known of feasts, such feasts, I mean, as you,
 more devoted to the service of God than to the service of ladies, were
 wont to observe in such profusion; nor was this threshold ever
 crossed by Saturday or Friday or vigil or Ember-days or Lent, that
 is so long; rather here we are at work day and night, threshing the
 wool, and well I know how featly it went when the matin bell last
 sounded. <milestone id="p02100034" />Wherefore with him I mean to stay, and to work while
 I am young, and postpone the observance of feasts and times of
 indulgence and fasts until I am old: so get you hence, and good luck
 go with you, but depart with what speed you may, and observe as
 many feasts as you like, so I be not with you.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02100035" />The pain with which Messer Ricciardo followed this outburst
 was more than he could bear, and when she had done, he exclaimed:
 <q direct="unspecified">Ah! sweet soul of me, what words are these that thou
 utterest? Hast thou no care for thy parents' honour and thine
 own? Wilt thou remain here to be this man's harlot, and to live
 in mortal sin, rather than live with me at Pisa as my wife? Why,
 when he is tired of thee, he will cast thee out to thy most grievous
 dishonour. I will ever cherish thee, and ever, will I nill I, thou
 wilt be the mistress of my house. <milestone id="p02100036" />Wouldst thou, to gratify this
 unbridled and unseemly passion, part at once with thy honour and
 with me, who love thee more dearly than my very life? Ah!
 cherished hope of me, say not so again: make up thy mind to come
 with me. As I now know thy bent, I will henceforth constrain
 myself to pleasure thee: wherefore, sweet my treasure, think better
 of it, and come with me, who have never known a happy hour since
 thou wert reft from me.</q> 
<milestone id="p02100037" />The lady answered: <q direct="unspecified">I expect not, nor
 is it possible, that another should be more tender of my honour than
 I am myself. Were my parents so, when they gave me to you? I
 trow not; nor mean I to be more tender of their honour now than
 they were then of mine. And if now I live in mortar sin, I will
 ever abide there until it be pestle sin:<note>A poor jeu de mots, mortaio,
 mortar, being substituted for mortale.</note> concern yourself no further
 <pb n="170" />on my account. 
<milestone id="p02100038" />Moreover, let me tell you, that, whereas at Pisa
 'twas as if I were your harlot, seeing that the planets in conjunction
 according to lunar mansion and geometric square intervened between
 you and me, here with Paganino I deem myself a wife, for he holds
 me in his arms all night long and hugs and bites me, and how he
 serves me, God be my witness. 
<milestone id="p02100039" />Ah! but you say you will constrain
 yourself to serve me: to what end? to do it on the third essay,
 and raise it by stroke of b&#226;ton? I doubt not you are become a
 perfect knight since last I saw you. Begone, and constrain yourself
 to live; for here, methinks, your tenure is but precarious, so hectic
 and wasted is your appearance. <milestone id="p02100040" />Nay more; I tell you this, that,
 should Paganino desert me (which he does not seem disposed to do
 so long as I am willing to stay with him), never will I return to
 your house, where for one while I staid to my most grievous loss
 and prejudice, but will seek my commodity elsewhere, than with
 one from whose whole body I could not wring a single cupful of sap.
 <milestone id="p02100041" />So, again, I tell you that here is neither feast nor vigil; wherefore
 here I mean to abide; and you, get you gone, in God's name with
 what speed you may, lest I raise the cry that you threaten to
 violate me.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02100042" />Messer Ricciardo felt himself hard bested, but he could not but
 recognise that, worn out as he was, he had been foolish to take a
 young wife; so sad and woebegone he quitted the room, and, after
 expending on Paganino a wealth of words which signified nothing,
 he at last gave up his bootless enterprise, and leaving the lady to her
 own devices, returned to Pisa; where for very grief he lapsed into
 such utter imbecility that, when he was met by any with greeting or
 question in the street, he made no other answer than <q direct="unspecified">the evil hole
 brooks no holiday,</q> and soon afterwards died. <milestone id="p02100043" />Which when Paganino
 learned, being well assured of the love the lady bore him, he made
 her his lawful wife; and so, keeping neither feast nor vigil nor Lent,
 they worked as hard as their legs permitted, and had a good time.
 Wherefore, dear my ladies, I am of opinion that Messer Bernab&#242; in
 his altercation with Ambrogiuolo rode the goat downhill.<note>I. e.
 argued preposterously, the goat being the last animal to carry a
 rider comfortably downhill.</note></p></div2><div2 type="conclusion" who="author" id="d02conclu"><head>Conclusion</head><p><milestone id="p02970001" />This story provoked so much laughter that the jaws of every one
 in the company ached; and all the ladies by common consent
 <pb n="171" />acknowledged that Dioneo was right, and pronounced Bernab&#242; a
 blockhead. <milestone id="p02970002" />But when the story was ended and the laughter had
 subsided, the queen, observing that the hour was now late, and that
 with the completion of the day's story-telling the end of her
 sovereignty was come, followed the example of her predecessor, and
 took off her wreath and set it on Neifile's brow, saying with gladsome
 mien, <q direct="unspecified">Now, dear gossip, thine be the sovereignty of this little
	people;</q> and so she resumed her seat. <milestone id="p02970003" />Neifile coloured somewhat
 to receive such honour, shewing of aspect even as the fresh-blown
 rose of April or May in the radiance of the dawn, her eyes rather
 downcast, and glowing with love's fire like the morning-star. But
 when the respectful murmur, by which the rest of the company gave
 blithe token of the favour in which they held their queen, was
 hushed, and her courage revived, she raised herself somewhat more
 in her seat than she was wont, and thus spoke: 
<milestone id="p02970004" /><q direct="unspecified">As so it is that
 I am your queen, I purpose not to depart from the usage observed
 by my predecessors, whose rule has commanded not only your
 obedience but your approbation. I will therefore in few words
 explain to you the course which, if it commend itself to your
 wisdom, we will follow. <milestone id="p02970005" />To-morrow, you know, is Friday, and the
 next day Saturday, days which most folk find somewhat wearisome
 by reason of the viands which are then customary, to say nothing of
 the reverence in which Friday is meet to be held, seeing that 'twas
 on that day that He who died for us bore His passion; wherefore
 'twould be in my judgment both right and very seemly, if, in honour
 of God, we then bade story-telling give place to prayer. 
<milestone id="p02970006" />On
 Saturday ladies are wont to wash the head, and rid their persons of
 whatever of dust or other soilure they may have gathered by the
 labours of the past week; not a few, likewise, are wont to practise
 abstinence for devotion to the Virgin Mother of the Son of God,
 and to honour the approaching Sunday by an entire surcease from
 work. Wherefore, as we cannot then completely carry out our
 plan of life, we shall, I think, do well to intermit our story-telling
 on that day also. <milestone id="p02970007" />We shall then have been here four days; and
 lest we should be surprised by new-comers, I deem it expedient that
 we shift our quarters, and I have already taken thought for our next
 place of sojourn. <milestone id="p02970008" />Where, being arrived on Sunday, we will assemble
 after our sleep; and, whereas to-day our discourse has had an ample
 <pb n="172" />field to range in, I propose, both because you will thereby have more
 time for thought, and it will be best to set some limits to the license
 of our story-telling, that of the many diversities of Fortune's handiwork
 we make one our theme, whereof I have also made choice, 
<milestone id="p02970009" />to
 wit, the luck of such as have painfully acquired some much-coveted
 thing, or having lost, have recovered it. Whereon let each meditate
 some matter, which to tell may be profitable or at least delectable to
 the company, saving always Dioneo's privilege.</q></p><p><milestone id="p02970010" />All applauded the queen's speech and plan, to which, therefore,
 it was decided to give effect. Thereupon the queen called her
 seneschal, told him where to place the tables that evening, and then
 explained to him all that he had to do during the time of her
 sovereignty. This done, she rose with her train, and gave leave to
 all to take their pleasure as to each might seem best. 
<milestone id="p02970011" />So the ladies
 and the men hied them away to a little garden, where they diverted
 themselves a while; then supper-time being come, they supped with
 all gay and festal cheer. When they were risen from the table,
 Emilia, at the queen's command, led the dance, while Pampinea,
 the other ladies responding, sang the ensuing song.</p><div3 who="pampinea" type="song"><lg><milestone id="p02970012" />
	<l>Shall any lady sing, if I not sing,</l>
	<l>I to whom Love did full contentment bring?</l>
      </lg><lg><milestone id="p02970013" />
	<l>Come hither, Love, thou cause of all my joy,</l>
	<l>Of all my hope, and all its sequel blest,</l>
	<l>And with me tune the lay,</l>
	<l>No more to sighs and bitter past annoy,</l>
	<l>That now but serve to lend thy bliss more zest;</l>
	<l>But to that fire's clear ray,</l>
	<l>Wherewith enwrapt I blithely live and gay,</l>
	<l>Thee as my God for ever worshipping.</l>
      </lg><lg><milestone id="p02970014" />
	<l>'Twas thou, O Love, didst set before mine eyes,</l>
	<l>When first thy fire my sould did penetrate,</l>
	<l>A youth to be my fere,</l>
	<l>So fair, so fit for deeds of high emprise,</l>
	<l>That ne'er another shall be found more great,</l>
	<l>Nay, nor, I ween, his peer:</l>
	<l>Such flame he kindled that my heart's full cheer</l>
	<l>I now pour out in chant with thee, my King.</l>
      </lg><pb n="173" /><lg><milestone id="p02970015" />
	<l>And that wherein I most delight is this,</l>
	<l>That as I love him, so he loveth me:</l>
	<l>So thank thee, Love, I must.</l>
	<l>For whatsoe'er this world can yield of bliss</l>
	<l>Is mine, and in the next at peace to be</l>
	<l>I hope through that full trust</l>
	<l>I place in him. And thou, O God, that dost</l>
	<l>It see, wilt grant of joy thy plenishing.</l>
      </lg></div3><p><milestone id="p02970016" />Some other songs and dances followed, to the accompaniment
      of divers sorts of music; after which, the queen deeming it time to
      go to rest, all, following in the wake of the torches, sought their
      several chambers. The next two days they devoted to the duties
      to which the queen had adverted, looking forward to the Sunday
      with eager expectancy.</p></div2></div1>
