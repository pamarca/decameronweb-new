      wake of light,
 and the birds, blithely chanting their lays among the green boughs,
 carried the tidings to the ear, when with one accord all the ladies and
 the three young men arose, and entered the gardens, where for no
 little time they found their delight in sauntering about the dewy
 meads, straying hither and thither, culling flowers, and weaving them
      into fair garlands. <milestone id="p02980003" />The day passed like its predecessor;
      they breakfasted
 in the shade, and danced and slept until noon, when they rose,
 and, at their queen's behest, assembled in the cool meadow, and sat
      them down in a circle about her. <milestone id="p02980004" />Fair and very debonair she shewed,
 crowned with her laurel wreath, as for a brief space she scanned the
 company, and then bade Neifile shew others the way with a story.
 Neifile made no excuse, and gaily thus began.</p></div2>
